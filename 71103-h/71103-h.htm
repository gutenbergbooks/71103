<p class="p2">The sheik deploring the result of the day’s hunt, I
expressed the hope that we should make up for it next
day; on this they were thrown into paroxysms, and
they set about the sheik, some by fair means, the rest
by foul, to prevent my doing anything save going
along the main road, or going any road except that
to Dar el Baida, whither I had no particular wish to
go. Despite these difficulties, I found means to concert
privately a chase for the next day. We were to be
limited to twenty guns, and, with a good supply of
beaters, to start early. In the morning, Sheik Tibi
and the other soldiers, after using every effort to stop
me, insisted on going also; thus, the sun was high
before we got a start. We drew two valleys with no
better success than the day before, expending two
hours on each. Being satisfied that there was a purpose
in this, I persisted in trying further off, and
being joined by thirty or forty men from the next
tribe, the oath was administered and we proceeded.
It was now a sight to see the boars, as they issued from
each of two valleys simultaneously beaten, running
about, listening and watching, starting and returning,
as the roll of musketry came up from both sides:
it was like shooting hares in a well-stocked preserve,
without dogs. The scenery surpassed that of the day
before. I was now quite at home with these people,
and it was only after it was over, that we thought it
might have been imprudent to start on such an expedition,
without knowing a word of their language,
and not only without, but in defiance of, the persons
charged with the care of us.</p>

<p>The boars enjoy a state of unparalleled happiness
under the fostering shadow of Islamism and the law
of Moses; a law not so observed in ancient Judæa as
in Modern Morocco, as may be seen by the denunciations
of the Prophets—the occupation of the Prodigal
Son and the selection made by the cast-out devils.
These two laws have excluded from this region domestic
pigs and peopled it with wild ones.</p>

<p>The Arabs hold them to be transformed men and
infidels; and converse with them, interpreting into
words their grunts and motions. Each Arab, as he
came up, soliloquised or addressed a curse to the carcasses,
as he would to a slaughtered doe. These
notions are natural enough, for they seem possessed
of man’s reason with brute’s force. We had commonly
an alarm at day-break of boars close to the douar, and
though instantly pursued by dogs and horsemen, they
managed to escape by speed, dodging, and short turns.
They move through the bushes with a surprising facility
of avoiding noise, squeezing by strength and
with their thick hides through places that appeared
utterly impassable. They get over everything, through
everything, and lie as close under cover as they are
alert when up. In starting for a chase, the boys commence
by plaiting the rush-like palm leaves into a
sling, for it is only by stones that they can start them.
No pigs are fed like these. They have the run of the
forests of cork, producing the bellota and the palmetto-root:
they prefer, however, the potato-like root
of the aram, which is called <dfn>yerni</dfn>, and grows generally
in the bunches of the palmetto. In substance it
is like a milky turnip, of a sweetish and mawkish
flavour. Next to this they feed on the narcissus, the
plant of which is called <dfn>bugareg</dfn>, and the root <dfn>bililouse</dfn>.
They like very much the <dfn>loto</dfn>, of which I have yet to
speak, and therefore deserve the name of lotofagoi.
It is called <dfn>folilla</dfn>. Their well-known predilection for
<dfn>turfel</dfn>—truffles—would be gratified in the extreme, were
it not that the taste of the Arab coincides with theirs.
Every square yard contains these plants, and when
the vegetation is dried up, these roots remain in the
ground fresh and succulent. No wonder, then, that
they prosper, with free quarters and full commons.</p>

<p>The tribes of the Tahel are wood-destroyers. They
consume constantly, and never plant. A portion of
their fuel is brushwood; but still the olive, the oak, and
the arar, the remnants of primeval forests, daily disappear.
Around Rabat, not a tree is to be seen; yet
the firewood is the roots which are dug out of the plain.</p>

<p>The copses, woods, and forests of the cork-tree,
which I have traversed, will have disappeared in a very
few years. This, however, is the effect of stripping
them of their bark for exportation. It was saddening
to pass through these groves, where the ancient patriarch
of the forest was circled by the scalping-knife,
which did not spare even the young promise by his
side; and, as if in savage ruthlessness, and not blinded
avarice, they sought to ensure the decay of the tree.
They had stripped the bark only to the height of a
man, neglecting the rest. They seek the bark only for
tanning. The cork stripped off was lying rotting
around. The cork may be taken from the tree, without
injury, as it covers the real bark through which
the sap runs. This the Spaniards never touch.</p>

<p>Four years ago, this speculation was introduced by
a French merchant. He offered 4,000 dollars for the
liberty of exportation, besides four per cent. duty.
The farm has risen this year to 25,000 dollars. The
Arabs seemed shocked at this work, but avoided the
subject with apparent uneasiness, whenever it was introduced.
I asked them why they did not plant trees
for their children, as they were constantly destroying
those that their fathers had left? The answer was,
“It is not the custom; if we planted them there
would be nobody to watch them, and they would be
destroyed.”</p>

<p>At present, large districts are destitute of douars
from the deficiency of fuel. A considerable portion
of the country I have passed over will soon be in the
same condition, unless by the reduction of the population
the forests are again allowed to spread. The extent
of the change within a century is marked by the
extinction of wild beasts. Travellers, a century ago,
narrate that they did not dare to pass the night out of
a douar for the lions and panthers. Reading these accounts
enables one to understand how the people of
Palestine were not to be driven out before the Jews
in one month or in one year, lest the beasts of the
field should multiply against them. In the times of
the Romans, the lions and panthers must have been
as numerous as are now the 
boars.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_1"></a><a href="#footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></span></p>

<p>The chief lady of the douar was too busy for ceremony;—she
left that department to her husband. She
was first lieutenant. But one evening, as we were
returning to the douar, she signified that she had
something to say, and conducting me into the tent,
made me sit down, and, seating herself opposite, said,
“Christian,—since the wives and daughters of your
country’s sheiks neither cook nor weave, nor make
butter, nor look after the guests or sheep, what do
they do?” Having already avowed that the greatest
sheik in the English country had not in his tent or
in his house a spindle or a loom, I explained how
our ladies occupied themselves. She shook her head,
and said, “It is not good;” but added, after a pause,
“Are your women happier than we?” I answered,
“Neither of you would take the life of the other. But
when I tell my countrywomen about you, they will be
glad to hear, and they will not say, 'it is not good.’”
“Christian,” she said, “what will you tell of me?”
I answered, “I will say I have seen the wife of an
Arab Sheik, and the mistress of an Arab tent, such
as we read of in the writings of
old,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_2"></a><a href="#footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></span> 
such as are the
models held up to our young maidens; such as we
listen to only in songs or see in dreams.”</p>

<p>Had a voice spoken from the earth, I could not
have been more startled. It was Nature saying to Art,
“What is thy worth?” What do we know of the
happiness and the uses that belong to the drudgeries
of life? Our harvest is of the briers and thorns of
a spirit uneasy and over-wrought. Here are no
changes in progress—no revolutions that threaten—no
theories at war—no classes that hate—and why?
The household works. There is no subdivision of
labour—the household, not the man, is the mint of
the state. It is so by its work, its varying cares,
and interchanging toil. These impose discipline, nurture
affection, knit and fortify that unit. Take away
these cares, this industry, this dexterity, this power of
standing alone, and what will—what can—a “home”
become, save a crib to sleep in, with a trough to feed
at, supplied from the butcher’s cart and the huckster’s
stall? Take from the household its industrial character,
and you take away its social charm, and its public
worth. You exchange domestic industry for political
economy—that is, the fictitious evils which it classifies:
for habits you substitute laws, that is, cumbrous
mockery: for happiness, refinement, that is, pretence:—and
you become possessed of the gifts of fortune—the
few at least who draw the prizes, only to lose the
value, of life.</p>

<p>The change in our manners is producing, no doubt,
an alteration in the position as well as in the happiness
of women. From my first acquaintance with the
East, I was struck with the erroneous notions which we
entertain regarding the state of the sex there. I could
not resist the evidence of their occupying relatively
a higher station, and I perceived that the difference
depended upon the greater strength of the family tie.
I find in an official French work<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_3"></a><a href="#footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></span>
my proposition
strengthened.</p>

<p>“In all the Sahara, the fabrication of stuffs is
exclusively the work of the women. The men apply
themselves to the culture of the date-trees. It has
been already shown that in the movements and expeditions,
the women have their share equally allotted
to them with the men. Thus, in the produce of the
labour of the Sahara, that of the women amounts to
one-half. In the intervals of their necessary household
occupations, they find time to contribute to the
common riches an equal quantity with the men.
This is a fact which it appears to us worthy of being
placed in evidence, because it is impossible that it
should remain without influence on the condition of
the female sex. The inutility of the occupations in
which they are engaged almost everywhere else, explains
perhaps, to a certain degree, and excuses the
state of dependence in which they are placed, and
the disregard of which they are the object; but where
by the nature of the occupations they are placed upon
a level equal with that of man, he must cease to
regard himself as the sole chief of the domestic hearth,
and be prepared to share the family sovereignty with
his companion. It is certain that in the Sahara the
merit of a woman is measured above all by her talents
and dexterity.”</p>

<p>In Egypt all things were consecrated, and then
displayed in types. The successive labours (as even
to these days in Africa) were announced from the
sanctuary, accompanied by sacrifices and processions,
and amidst the richness of their ceremonials,
and the pomp of their temples. The changes of the
seasons which they announced, appeared to flow from
their directing power, and the labours undertaken to be
the fruit of their providential care. Before calendars
were printed, all field labours had to be determined
by astronomy, and especially in the valley of the Nile,
which was subject to disappear under a deluge, and
whose fertility consisted in the rise and duration of the
flood. Placing ourselves in the soft and yielding, the
unlearned and unprejudiced embryo of society; man
groping his way, fearful to stray, yet eager to advance,
what more natural than a scientific priesthood and a
symbolical worship? The Greeks, copying these fruitful
symbols, sacrificed purpose and usefulness to grace.
The name of Moses, we are informed in Scripture,
means <dfn>saved from the water</dfn>. The Muses was the
same word: nine months in Egypt are <dfn>saved from the
waters</dfn>—these are the Muses. Each had its festival,
and the symbol of its occupation. There were three
other similar—these are the Graces—they are admitted
by the most learned Hellenists to be water-nymphs;—together
they make up the year. Here, then, we
have the homeliest occupations the basis of the religious
pomps of Egypt, and of the mythology and
art of Greece; the distribution of these works filled
up the year, combined field and in-door labour, and
linked the community, while furnishing the charm of
life.</p>

<p>The plough, the yoke, “The invention of gods and
the occupation of heroes;” are the loom, the spindle,
and distaff of less noble parentage? You sever the
distaff and the plough, the spindle and the yoke, and
you get factories and poor-houses, credit and panics—two
hostile notions, agricultural and commercial.
Poetry becomes politics, patriotism faction; and a
light-hearted and contented people rusts into clowns
or sharpens into knaves.</p>

<p>I made, amongst the Arabs, the discovery that home
industry was the secret of the permanency of their
society. I made, on subsequently visiting the Highlands,
another, namely, that <em>home-made stuffs are the
cheapest</em>. I refer, of course, to the common clothing
of the labouring population. The comparison cannot
be instituted where the habit has been extinguished;
for on the one hand, the implements and the dexterity
are wanting; on the other, fashion has set another way,
and new habits have arisen, adjusted to the articles and
stuffs that have been introduced. In the Highlands,
however, the comparison is easy, and I speak after
thorough examination, and with perfect certainty,
when I say that a family clothed by its own homework,
as compared with a family which buys its
clothes at the shop, saves one-third. Of course, in the
former case, no cotton will be used, and home-bred
wool and home-grown flax will be the staple.</p>

<p>The change in this respect is generally deplored;
but it is considered as inevitable, it being the result of
cheapness, no hand-labour being able to stand against
machinery. But the heavy charges are not for the
operation but for the capital engaged, and the numerous
transfers and profits. Home-spinning <em>costs
nothing</em>.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_4"></a><a href="#footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></span>
Twenty pounds of wool converted unobtrusively
into the yearly clothing of a labourer’s family,
makes no show; but bring it to market, send it to the
factory, bring it thence to broker, send it to dealer, and
it will represent commercial operations and apparent
capital to the amount of twenty times its value, and
costs the labourer, when returned to him, twice as
much as it would cost him money in dyeing, spinning,
weaving, &amp;c. The working class is thus amerced to
support a wretched factory population, a parasitical,
shopkeeping class, and a fictitious, commercial, monetary,
and financial system. The landlord, for his
share, pays five shillings per acre poors-rates. And all
this is the result, not of cheapness, but delusion. The
people of England were better clothed and fed than at
present, when there were no commerce and no factories.
At this moment, after exhausting human ingenuity,
they are returning to domestic labour, as a
means of remedying the evils of Ireland!</p>

<p>Hallam has admitted that in those times which we
look back on with pity, the labourer received twice as
much as at present for his labour. This is a terrible
blow and a fearful avowal. Mr. Macaulay, on the
contrary, “sees nothing but progress, hears of nothing
but decay.” He must have transposed the two senses,
or carefully selected the spots for indulging in their
use: if, indeed, by progress he means approach towards
a fair remuneration for labour, and by decay a falling
away from just judgment in important concerns. Or
is it his purpose to cover Hallam’s indiscretion?—“They
say that in former times the people were better
off. The time will come that they will say the same
of this.” If we be in a state of progress, those who
speak thus must be very foolish, and if the proposition
deserved notice it required refutation.</p>

<p>The Arab tent, without our waking follies, presents
to us the reality of our dreams. Property has there
its value, wealth its honour, labour its reward. On
the one side, the fruits of wisdom without effort, on
the other the toil of the understanding without profit.</p>

<p>But the Arab woman asked, “Are your women happier
than we?” The European lady would be shocked
at the bare possibility of comparison. She shrinks
from domestic occupation, yet is she not able to
expel nature, so as to despise Nausicaa and Naomi. We
cannot refuse to bow before the shades of the heroic
or patriarchal times—our nature acknowledges Abraham

or Alcinous. Yet, if our condition be that of
refinement, how contemptible must be Tanaquil and
her distaff, Penelope and her loom?</p>

<p>An English lady, who had the means of comparison,
has not hesitated to assert that between an Eastern and
an European household, the balance of happiness leans
to the side of the former; and in the Eastern household
it is certainly the women who have the larger share—who
are the idols, and who possess authority such as
belongs not to our courts, and affections on the part
of those under their sway which belong not even to
our dreams. The most touching words of the wisest
of men are the description of the mistress of a household.
It is an Arab woman he describes.</p>

<p>“Look at the hand of man! The best gift of Providence!
What so perfect in mechanism, what so
beautiful in form? Is it not given for work, and
ought not that work to be for the service of those we
love? Can we omit that use without the sacrifice of
more than words can tell? Let not any one who follows
the picture disturb the effort of his own imagination,
to fill it up by thinking of the possibility of
carrying it into effect. Obstacles arise at every point.
Our set habits all point the other way. Julia could
work for her husband because there was then a noble
and an antique costume. An empress, she could summon
about her her handmaidens, because there was a
formula of ceremony which enabled all ranks to associate
without derogation or familiarity. Then there was
the hall to assemble in. 'The plant,’ still stood in every
house. Because all this is gone, are we not to count
the loss? If we cannot restore, let us not mistake.
If we cannot return, let us not hurry on—in the wrong
direction. It is something to know whither we are
going, when the speed is the result of our own will.</p>

<p>“Nations are not changed by time or accident—they
change themselves. Progress of society—march of intellect!
Good heavens! we can utter such trash and call
ourselves reasonable beings: as well speak of the justice
of a steam-engine, or the virtue of a rocket. What need
to examine their state;—their words suffice. When
the phrases have gone mad, what can be in order?</p>

<p>“It is something in the midst of empires crumbling
to the earth and civilization gasping for breath and
struggling with itself for life, to point to the permanency
of single tribes, who have never reasoned, but
who have simple habits; and to be able to say to the
wildly-frantic or to the meekly-deluded, ‘Christians,
ye are incorrigible.’”</p>

<p>Such were the concluding words of a series of
articles by M. Blacque, which appeared in the <cite>Moniteur
Ottoman</cite>, in 1834. Since then fifteen years—barren,
save in convulsions such as many centuries
have not witnessed before—have justified his judgment
on Europe’s condition, and his anticipations of her fate.
M. Odillon Barrot, his cousin, on one occasion said
that had he returned, he “would have played a great
part in France.” I answered, “He would have made
France play a worthy one.” He was offered the
highest offices in the Russian Government, and on
refusing them was persecuted <em>by his own</em>. The
Turkish Government then adopted him, and he was
poisoned while on his way to England. The incidents
of his life and death, no less than the passages left
by his pen, will serve at a future time, perhaps, to
illustrate that chimera with a brain of cobwebs and a
heart of mud, which is called civilization, and which
we are pleased to designate as the child of science and
the parent of corruption.</p>

<p>But I do not speak of “civilization,” as an <em>entity</em>.
It will be found in no classical writer, Greek or Roman,
English or French, German or Italian. It is a word
which belongs to us,—exclusively to us; let us be
either proud or conscious—its invention must be
either a merit or a shame.</p>

<p><em>What is it?</em> It is no standard. We have the
words “excellence,” and “perfection.” It is no description
of a particular people, for it neither does
nor can describe or define. Its own sense has to be
defined. Whoever uses the word, conjures up to correspond
with it an idea of some aggregate condition,
which never can have the same parts in any two
speakers’ minds, or in the mind of the same speaker at
any two moments. It is an unknown quantity, like
<dfn>x</dfn> in algebra; but instead of concluding the operation
by finding out its value, we commence the proposition
by supposing it known. These are the reasons why
you do not find it in any classical writer. These are
the reasons why it has been received as a discovery
for this generation. It facilitates talk without meaning,
is a cloak for ignorance and pretence, and covers,
by an apparent “grasp of intellect,” the shrinking
from intellectual effort, which consists in getting possession
of the instruments we use, and in fathoming
the meaning and assuring ourselves of the accuracy
of the terms we employ. It is made up of things
that have no ratio—virtue and science, wealth and
political order; so also, vice, ignorance, poverty, and
discontent—each of these must be found in it: to
employ it logically, you must class plus and minus
quantities and rate each in decimals. So in one
country there would be so many degrees of positive,
in another so many of negative civilization. If you
cannot do this, you use an instrument that is necessarily
false; the whole field of your intellectual operation
must be, as it is, reduced to that condition in
which our buildings, railways, and accounts would be,
if arithmeticians and engineers were to create an
elementary sign of number, the value of which was
uncertain, and might be mistaken for an 8 or a 9. It
is the case, not of an error of opinion, but of false process,
which renders it impossible to be right. It is not
opinions, but words, that ruin states. Should a sane
people occupy Europe after the Gothic race has been
put down or swept away, the title of M. Guizot’s great
work will suffice for the history of times distinguished
at once by a fatuity that cannot reason,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_5"></a><a href="#footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></span>
and an
activity that will not rest. Alas for man, if such
things as we have seen since the conversation in the
Arab tent, which prompted these reflections, were the
fruit of the proper use of his faculties! Alas for folly
too, if, with such men for its apostles, institutions
could endure or nations prosper!</p>

 The spinning-wheel of the Highlands is one of the most
remarkable inventions. That formerly used in England, and still
lingering where here and there a housewife has sense to say, “I
cannot <em>afford</em> to buy in the shops stockings for my family,” was
like that used now in the East, and anciently figured in Egypt.
A wheel was turned by one hand, whilst with the other the wool,
cotton, or flax was prepared for the spindle: as each portion was
twisted the wheel was reversed, so as to run it on the spindle;
but in the <dfn>coil</dfn> the thread passes through an orifice in the axis
of the spindle, and is then carried by a bar to be distributed
over the <dfn>pirn</dfn>. The wheel runs always on, and when yielded
by the fingers, passes to the coil. Both hands are free for the
work. The wheel being turned by a treddle, it is, compared
to other spinning, as the delving of the Basque provinces to
all other methods of culture, and performs at least twice as much
work.</p>

 Yet in M. Guizot’s organ such a sentence as the following
could be pronounced on “civilization,” and such a verdict given
for “barbarism.” “Amongst us, the intelligence and the moral
sense developed to excess, are troubled with the habit of judging
of particular facts through the medium of general ideas, and
more or less complicated systems. Among the Arabs, reason is
in its simplicity, but also in all its primitive clearness and rectitude:
the idea of what is just and what is unjust is always clear
and sure.”—<cite lang="fr">L’Epoque</cite>, April 11, 1846.</p>

<p class="p2">After a few days spent as those I have described,
we started in a south-westerly direction, and towards
evening passed out of the land of the Ziaïdas. Their
territory extends a summer day’s journey from north
to south, and from east to west. We then entered
that of the Ladzian. Our guardians inquired from
the shepherds touching different douars, to select one
for sleeping, but did not seem satisfied with the replies.
I urged going to one of the Lachedumbra, a tribe of
the Ladzian, and they reluctantly complied. This was
the first douar we approached as perfect strangers.
We rode up to within two hundred paces and halted.
After we had waited about ten minutes we advanced
half way and halted again. Then one man walked
slowly out; one of our party in like manner advanced.
They saluted. After some time the Arab shouted,
and instantly a single man advanced from each of the
tents on the side next us: they stood for some minutes
as if holding council. The chief then turned round,
and walking straight up to me, took my hand in their
manner, and thrice repeated <cite>Mirababick</cite>; the others
then advanced, and pronounced the salutation all
together. Each of the party was thus greeted in turn.
We were led inside. The whole douar set to work,
and in a few minutes our tent was pitched, and strewed
with fresh shrubs. A sheep was led up to the door,
the customary present of the sheik, that we might
see it before we made our supper on it. This was
a Sherriff’s douar, and the government officers have
no right to enter. Such was the explanation given
to me. It is difficult to ascertain, and impossible to
vouch for, the commonest fact in a country where one
is not thoroughly conversant with its habits, and when
information is received through interpreters, however
intelligent and upright these may be; and, indeed,
integrity is next to an impossibility in an interpreter;
but this an eastern traveller learns, if at all, at the
wrong end of his experience.</p>

<p>I have seen no douar entered except by the free
will, and in some cases the formal consent, of the
tribe. I was much perplexed at this, as it appeared
at first a contradiction to, and as I afterwards ascertained,
modification of the fundamental rule of Arab
society. It doubtless arose from the necessity of
defence against a <em>central government</em>.</p>

<p>After they had pitched our tent, instead of pressing
upon us as amongst the Ziaïda, they drew off about
thirty yards, and squatted down in a circle: a few
only came, and then it was to bring presents, or to
petition for medicine for a greasy heel, or a barren
wife, as the case might be. I proposed to the sheik a
boar hunt, to which he readily assented; but it was
fixed for a future day.</p>

<p>From the high ground, as we approached it, Dar El
Baida has an imposing appearance: inside it is a heap
of ruins. A house consisting of a single room—a good
one on a second floor, and entered from a terrace—was
prepared for us. Our horses were piqueted in the
street before it. We understood there was a French
Consular agent and some Europeans here, and consequently
we brought for them a camel-load of game.</p>

<p>This place is said to have been retaken from the
Portuguese by the following stratagem. A Moor pretended
to become Christian, settled in the town, and
obtained permission to have a gate opened in the wall
close to his house for the convenience of sending in
and out his flocks. He one night brought in a number
of his countrymen covered with hides, as cattle among
them. Such is the story of the place; and if you
doubt it, they say, “There is the gate.”</p>

<p>The Spanish name is Casa Bianca, just as if we
chose to call it “White House.” Its ancient name,
“Anafe,” involves some obscurity. The same name
belonged to a colony in Asia Minor, and to an island
close to Crete, which forms an episode in the Orphic
epic of the Argonauts. The adventurers were rescued
by Apollo, who discharging an arrow into the deep,
the island arose, and was called Anafe, from <ins title="anaphainein" lang="el">ἀνφααίνειν</ins>,
<dfn>to appear</dfn>. What this etymology is worth for the
Cretan Island, it must also be for the Lybian promontory:
its present name likewise implies brightness. It
is on the other hand asserted, that this is the new
case of <i lang="la">lucus a non lucendo</i>, and that Anafe means,—that
is, in Hebrew not Greek,—dark and gloomy,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_6"></a><a href="#footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></span> and
that the island was so called, not from having appeared
in the light, but by being shut out from the light by
groves.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_7"></a><a href="#footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></span>
If so, the Lybian promontory must likewise
in those days have been green and feathered, and not
as now, naked and pale. The Phœnician Backs and
Parrys did not dot their charts with the names of
the Admiralty Lords of Tyre. They gave names descriptive
or commemorative, as the other names of this
coast will vouch. That the name is Phœnician, not
Greek, is clear from finding it here. We have also
Thymiatirium, where Arzilla now stands, and which
is interpreted in Hebrew—an open plain. Ampelusa
was on the northern promontory, and its interpretation
coincides with the descriptions left of groves
delightful to the eye, filled with fruit grateful to the
taste. This must have been one of the spots first
named, and this name seems to confirm what we derive
from so many sources regarding the primeval horticulture
of this land. Had the Phœnicians come to
plant vines, and gardens—that is, to cultivate and civilize—they
would not have given such a name. These
glimpses of the well-being in the most early times bring
up the contrast with the present. The parched and
naked brow of the once shady Anafe, further recalls
an island nearer home, once, also, named after its
forests,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_8"></a><a href="#footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></span>
where now scarce a tree is to be found.
Would that the resemblance were complete! If Moorish
rule has blasted the oak, it has at least spared the
man. What Moorish rule has worst done it has done
with a purpose, and neither on principle nor for philanthropy.</p>

<p>A quantity of grain was in store, and much arriving
destined for England. The stores were filled all
along the coast, but there are no means of shipment.
This port is a principal place for the exportation of
bark and wool, both managed by Scheik Tibi, who,
last season, when the country was otherwise impassable,
went and came, conducting caravans of seventy
and eighty camels; by his personal character ensuring
safety on the road. The schooner which had been
in company with us during our voyage, lay on the
beach high and dry. An English brig at anchor in
the open roadstead was pitching bows under, though
there was scarcely a breath of wind, and had narrowly
escaped shipwreck two days before from her
cables having been cut by the rocks.</p>

<p>There is here a sort of bay. The southern horn is a
headland running a little way out, and distant four or
five miles. On its bald black brow I was told that
traces of the Phœnician city were to be seen. I was all
impatience to reach the spot, for it was just a site for
them, and no one since would have gone there. So
here was the site of a Lybo-Phœnician city, and any
fragment was precious. I found nothing standing, yet
was not disappointed; for the stones in the fields were
rolled fragments of building: the mortar was of such
consistency that it wore or split only with the stones
imbedded in it, and these were crystalline: the stones
were small, the mortar abundant; the masses looked
like amygdaloid. For the first time was I assured that
I beheld a piece of Tyrian rubble. I would have travelled
many a mile for this. Mortar was used by
them—and what mortar! But this was not the only
architectural point I had to mark this day.</p>

<p>As I sat on the brow of the headland, watching the
great waves which went and came over long shelves of
rocks, stretching out to the west and southward in the
line of the declining sun, and playing under his rays,
my eye was attracted to a singular mass immediately
below: it was a cone indented all over with deep
semicircular cavities, and, therefore, bristling with
truncated points. The sandstone hollows out in this
manner<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_9"></a><a href="#footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></span>
by the action of the water, and the points
which are left are sharp as a knife. The substance is
black and porous, like a sponge. When the foam
dashed over this rock, the basins filled; the white froth,
as the wave retired, poured in cataracts from basin to
basin, on every side, and so continued almost till the
next long wave came to shroud it in spray, and replenish
it with foam. As I watched these changes,
familiar forms floated before me, till at last becoming
more distinct, I distinguished those singular pendants
that belong to the Moorish vault, and the indentures
of its arch. The stalactites of caverns might
have furnished the type of the last, but could not of
the former. The fair creations of art have models in
Nature, and here is that of the Moorish. The substance
in which it is exhibited lines the whole coast,
and must present an infinite variety of such effects.
I had few occasions of seeing that coast, but the very
next time I reached it, about twenty miles north of
Rabat, I saw the same figure reversed, or as we see it
in the Moresco vault, depending from the roof like the
stalactites in a cave.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_10"></a><a href="#footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>I returned to the same place next morning, but the
tide was out, and the rock without the foam was a
common stone. The ledges of rock which the evening
before had been so lashed by the waves, were white
(quartz) rock. On them were patches of coarse recent
madrepores, looking like gigantic sponges. Further
out the rocks were black, and on inspection proved to
be so because completely covered with mussels, the
largest I have ever seen, and the finest I have ever
tasted. Such is the fury of the waves, that beautifully-rounded
quartz-stones, some of them three-quarters of
a hundred weight, have been cast up into a bank thirty
feet above high-water-mark.</p>

<p>Amongst the mass of ruins within the walls of Dar
el Baida one building alone could be made out. It
was a bath. If London or Paris were laid low, no
such monument would survive of their taste, luxury, or
cleanliness. The people called it “Roman,” meaning
Portuguese. When I was at Algesiras, some excavations
were making, and on examining them, the building
proved to be a bath. Within the circuit of the walls
of old Ceuta, which unquestionably belonged to a very
remote period, the only edifice, the purpose of which is
distinguishable, is a bath. The vestiges of the Romans,
which from time to time we fall upon in our island,
are baths. The Romans and the Saracens were the
most remarkable of conquerors, and are associated in
the relics which they have left-fortresses and baths.
The first is of necessity, but how should the second
be ever found conjoined, unless it played some part
in forming that temper which made them great, or in
conferring on them those manners which rendered
them acceptable? A nation without the bath is deprived
of a large portion of the health and inoffensive
enjoyment within man’s reach: it therefore increases
the value of a people to itself, and its power
as a nation over other people. From what I know
of the loss in both respects which those incur who
have it not, I can estimate its worth to those who
had it.</p>

<p>I now had the opportunity of examining a public
bath of the Moors belonging to their good times.
The disposition varies from that of the ancient
Thermæ and the modern Hamams. The grand and
noble portion of the Turkish and the ancient bath was
a dome, open to the heavens in the centre. Such a
one, but not open in the centre, is here; it was the
inner not the outer apartment. The vault has deep
ribs, in the fashion of a clam shell, and is supported
upon columns with horse-shoe arches spreading between.
Instead of a system of flues through the walls,
only one passed through the centre under the floor.
To get at it, I had to break through the pavement of
beaten mortar covering a slab of marble. It was
nearly filled up with a deposit, partly of soot and
partly of earthy matter, which I imagined to be the
residuum of gazule, on the use of which hinge the
peculiarities I have noticed in the structure and distribution
of the building.</p>

<p>I turned to Leo Africanus, expecting a flood of light
upon a matter with which he must have been so
familiar. All I found was this:—“When any one is
to be bathed, they lay him along the ground, <em>anointing
him with certain ointment</em> and with certain
<em>instruments clearing away his filth</em>.” The ointment
is evidently the gazule; the instrument can only be
the <dfn>strigil</dfn>. He mentions a “Festival of the Baths.”
The servants and officers go forth with trumpets and
pipes, and all their friends, to gather <em>a wild onion</em>; it
is put in a brazen vessel, covered over with a linen
cloth, which had been steeped in lees of wine; this they
bring with great solemnity and rejoicings, and suspend
in the vessel in the portal of the bath. This would
indicate an Egyptian source, were it not for the absence
of all trace of the bath on their storied walls, and
among their ruins.</p>

<p>The onion, however, being the emblem of the planetary
system,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_11"></a><a href="#footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></span>
may be a trace of Sabæism. The
festival and ceremony savour much of those of the
“Great Mother,” and of course preceded Christianity.
No original superstition arose here; no original bath
appears among the Arabs. The Phœnicians brought
their religion and found the bath, and to it the people
adapted the new religious practices.</p>

<p>Part of the funereal rites of the Moors was to
convey the corpse to the bath.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_12"></a><a href="#footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></span>
Such a practice is
unknown in any other country, and seems to identify
the bath with the primitive usages.</p>

<p>The gazule furnishes, however, the strongest intrinsic
evidence in favour of my conclusion, which indeed
it requires but scanty proof to establish, for the
rudest people may have had the bath. The Red
Indians are fully acquainted with it, and the means
they employ are heated stones and a leather covering.
They crawl in and throw water on the stones, and soak
till the same effect is produced as the Balnea of Rome
obtained. In Morocco they are of primitive and modest
structure, and of diminutive proportions. Add to
this, the rude simplicity of the process, and the exclusive
use in them of natural and native productions.
Before coming to this point, I wish to refer to historical
evidence.</p>

<p>Augustus borrowed a stool, called
<dfn>duretum</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_13"></a><a href="#footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></span> from
Spain. Mauritania was inhabited by the same people,
so that two thousand years ago the Romans copied the
Moors.</p>

<p>Few Iberian words have come down to us—one
of them is <dfn>strigil</dfn>. It applied to a species of metal;
and strigils were made of metal. The early use
of this strigil, and its connection with the East, is
shown by one of the celebrated bronzes of antiquity—a
group of two boys in the bath using the strigil,
which was attributed to
Dædalus.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_14"></a><a href="#footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></span> The Etruscans
and Lydians also had
it.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_15"></a><a href="#footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>The Phæacians, as elsewhere shown, were Phœnicians.
Homer mentions their baths at the time of the
Trojan war, when the Greeks had none. The term
<ins title="Herakleia loutra" lang="el">Ἡρακλεία λούτρα</ins> seems to identify baths with that
people as much as letters were by the term <ins title="Kadmeia grammata" lang="el">Καδμεία γράμματα</ins>;
and as the Greeks got everything from
them, the baths of the Greeks are in themselves a
testimony in favour of the Phœnicians, my inference
being, not that the Phœnicians brought thither the
tice, but that they learnt it here.</p>

<p>That the Arabs, when they issued from their deserts,
should have adopted the Thermæ and Balnea of the
sinking Roman empire, does not necessarily follow;
indeed it is rather to be assumed that they would not,
and that it was from a people who became by religion
incorporated with them, and from whom, indubitably,
they derived their architecture, that they had it.
This view is supported by the use of the glove, which
is not Roman, and the disuse of the strigil, which
was so. It would thus appear that Morocco had conferred
on antiquity and the East of the present day,
the chief luxury of the one, and the most beneficial
habit of the other.</p>

<p>There being a bath in the unoccupied house of the
Governor of the Province, I made the attempt to complete
my investigation by experience, and privately
applied to the guardian of the mansion, who, to my
surprise, immediately acceded to my request. Soon
after, he came to inform me that the Caïd had been
very angry, and had forbidden him to let me use it.
It was suggested that there were mollifying methods,
such as a civil message, a box of tea and some loaves
of sugar. While these were preparing, an elderly
Moor walked in and seated himself. This was no
other than the Caïd. He plunged at once <i lang="la">in medias
res</i>, and the following dialogue ensued.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Caïd.</span> No Christian or Jew can go to the bath. It
is forbidden by our law.</p>

<p>Can a law forbid what it enjoins?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Caïd.</span> It is the law.</p>

<p>Where is that law?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Caïd.</span> (After a pause.) The wise men say there is
such a law.</p>

<p>The wise man is he who speaks about what he
knows.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Caïd.</span> Do the wise men err?</p>

<p>Have you read the book?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Caïd.</span> I have heard it read.</p>

<p>Did you hear the word—the Jews and Christians
shall not bathe?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Caïd.</span> I may or may not have heard.</p>

<p>I have read the book, and have not seen that word,
for in it there is no name for bath. The Mussulmans,
when they came to “the West,” found the bath in
your towns as they are to-day, and here first learned
how to bathe, and you were then Christians. How
then do you say you have a law which forbids the
Jews or the Christians to go to the bath?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Caïd.</span> (laughing). The Nazarenes are cunning. In
what Mussulman land do Christians go to the bath?</p>

<p>Missir, is it not a Mussulman land? Stamboul
(Constantinople), is it not a Mussulman land? Now,
I will ask you questions. Where, except in this dark
West, do Christians not go to the bath with the Mussulmans?
Why do I want to go to the bath? Have we
got the bath in Europe? From whom did I learn it?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Caïd.</span> How can I tell?</p>

<p>I have gone to the bath with doctors of the law
(Oulema), and Rejals of the Ali Osman Doulet: I have
been shampooed by vizirs. From Mussulmans I have
learned how to wash myself, and here I come to Mussulmans,
and they say, “You shall not bathe.” This
is not Islam, this is
<em>Jahilic</em>.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_16"></a><a href="#footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="speaker">Caïd.</span> You shall not say our faces are black. You
shall go, but—only once. To-morrow I will keep the
key: it shall be heated when the Mussulmans are
asleep. I will come, and you shall go and be satisfied.</p>

<p>He then got up and walked off. Presently a sheep
arrived as an earnest and propitiation.</p>

<p>It was so often and so confidently repeated to me
by the resident Europeans that I could place no reliance
upon his word, that I gave up all idea of it.
Next night, as we were disposing our beds and preparing
to occupy them, there was a rap at the door,
and on its being opened, who should walk in but the
Caïd. His abrupt salutation was, “The bath is ready—come.”
While I was re-dressing, he told us that
he had forgotten, and having business of importance
with a neighbouring sheik before sunrise, had started
on his journey, when recollecting his promise, he had
returned.</p>

<p>Finding he was making dispositions to accompany
me, I begged he would not take the trouble; but not
staying to answer, he seized with one hand a candle
out of the candlestick, laid hold of my hand with the
other, conducted me down stairs, lighting me and
lifting me through the dirty streets over the different
places, as if I had been a helpless child. Arrived at
the place, he took the keys from his breast, and opened
the doors. I thought his care was to end here, but he
squatted himself down on a mat in an outhouse, as if
to wait the issue. Every other argument failing, I
said, that if he remained there, I could not stay long
enough. He answered, “I will sleep. If I went home
I could not sleep, for something might happen.” The
deputy-governor stripped to officiate as bath-man.
But for this weighty matter I must take breath, and
honour it with a special chapter—a chapter which, if
the reader will peruse it with diligence and apply with
care, may prolong his life, fortify his body, diminish
his ailments, augment his enjoyments, and improve
his temper: then having found something beneficial
to himself, he may be prompted to do something to
secure the like for his fellow-creatures.</p>

<p class="p2">It is amusing to hear people talk of cleanliness
as they would of charity or sobriety. A man can
no more be clean than learned by impulse, and no
more by his will understand cleanliness than solve
equations. Cleanliness has the characters of virtue
and of vice—it is at once beneficial and seductive. It
is also a science and an art, for it has an order which
has to be taught, and it requires dexterity and implements.
It has its prejudices and superstitions: it
abhors what is not like itself, and clings to its practices
under a secret dread of punishment and fear of sin.
It has its mysteries and its instincts: it regards not
the eye or favour of man, and follows the bent of its
nature without troubling itself with reasons for what
it does; it has its charities and its franchises: the
poorest is not without the reach of its aid, nor the
most powerful strong enough to infringe its
rights.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_17"></a><a href="#footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></span>
It is suited to every condition: men and women, the
young and the old, the rich and the poor, the hale and
the sick, the sane and the insane: the savage can
enjoy it no less than the refined. The most polished
have prized it as the chief profit of art; the simple
receive it as the luxury of Nature—a cheap solace for
the cares of life, and a harmless medicament for the
infirmities of man.</p>

<p>The philosopher prized it as essential to
happiness,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_18"></a><a href="#footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></span>
the austere to virtue, the dissolute to
vice.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_19"></a><a href="#footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></span> To corrupt
Greece and Rome it furnished a gratification that
was innocent; to the rigid sectarians of the Koran
an observance that was seductive; multiplying the
sensibilities and strengthening the frame, it increased
to all the value of life. No sacrifice is required for
its possession. Nothing has to be given up in exchange:
it is pure gain to have, sheer loss to want.
Like the light of heaven, those only walk not in it
who are blind. Where not practised, it is not inducements
that are wanting, but knowledge: “they
don’t know
how.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_20"></a><a href="#footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>Our body is a fountain of impurities, to which
man is more subject than the
beast.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_21"></a><a href="#footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></span> The body of
man, far more than that of the brutes, is exposed to
be contaminated; and by an artificial mode of life
and food, he has further multiplied his frailties. By
casing his body in closely-fitting clothes—integuments
rather than covering—he has shut out the purifying
elements. Without the means of cleanliness of the
brute, he is also without the guidance of its instinct;
what then, if in the culture of his body, he should
lose the light of reason? If reason and not instinct
be his portion, it is because he is endowed with a
mechanism, to keep which in order instinct would
not suffice. What if that mechanism receive at his
hands not such care as would be bestowed upon it,
if it belonged to the beast of the field or the bird
of the air!</p>

<p>What filth is to the body, error is to the mind;
and therefore if we are to use our reason in regard to
the former, we must have a standard of cleanliness as
well as of truth; such a rule we can owe neither to
freak nor fashion. We must look for one tested by
long experience and fixed from ancient days:—this
standard is <span class="allsmcap">THE BATH</span>. This is no ideal one; it is at
once theory and performance; he who has gone
through it, knows what it is to be clean because he
is cleansed. I shall use as synonymous the words,
“cleanliness,” and the “bath.”</p>

<p>I must beg the reader to dismiss from his mind
every idea connected with that word: unless I thought
he would and could do so, I should persist in speaking
of <span class="place">Thermæ</span>,
<span class="place">Balneum</span> or <span class="place">Hamâm</span>, but I trust I may
venture to naturalize, in its true sense, the word in
our tongue as a step to naturalise the thing in our
habits.</p>

<p>A people who know neither Latin nor Greek have
preserved this great monument of antiquity on the
soil of Europe, and present to us who teach our children
only Latin and Greek, this institution in all its
Roman grandeur, and its Grecian taste. The bath,
when first seen by the Turks, was a practice of their
enemies, religious and political; they were themselves
the filthiest of mortals; they had even instituted filth
by laws and consecrated it by
maxim.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_22"></a><a href="#footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></span> Yet no
sooner did they see the bath than they adopted it;
made it a rule of their society, a necessary adjunct
to every settlement; and Princes and Sultans endowed
such institutions for the honour of their
name.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_23"></a><a href="#footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>In adopting it, they purified it from immorality and
excess, and carrying the art of cleanliness to the
highest perfection, have made themselves thereby the
most sober-minded and contented amongst the nations
of the earth. This arose from no native disposition
towards cleanliness, but from the simplicity of their
character and the poverty of their
tongue.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_24"></a><a href="#footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></span> They had
no fallacious term into which to convert it, and no
preconceived ideas by which to explain it. Knowing
they were dirty, they became clean; having common
sense, they did not rush on a new device, or set up
either a “water cure,” or a joint-stock washing company;
but carefully considered and prudently adopted
what the experience of former ages presented to their
hands.</p>

<p>I have said that the Saracens, like the Romans,
have left behind them, <em>temples</em>, <em>fortresses</em>, and <em>baths</em>:
national security reared its battlements, public faith
its domes, and cleanliness, too, required its structures,
and without these no more could it exist, than defence
or worship. I shall not weary the reader with ground-plans
or “elevations,” and shall confine myself to the
leading features, in so far as they are connected with
use. They are vast and of costly materials, from their
very nature. Before describing the Moorish bath, I
must request the reader to accompany me through the
bath as it is used by the Turks, which, as more complete
and detailed, is more intelligible.</p>

<p>The operation consists of various parts: first, the
<em>seasoning of the body</em>; second, the <em>manipulation of
the muscles</em>; third, the <em>peeling of the epidermis</em>;
fourth, the <em>soaping</em>, and the patient is then conducted
to <em>the bed of repose</em>. These are the five acts of the
drama. There are three essential apartments in the
building: a great hall or <dfn>mustaby</dfn>, open to the outer
air; a middle chamber, where the heat is moderate;
the inner hall, which is properly the <dfn>thermæ</dfn>. The
first scene is acted in the middle chamber; the next
three in the inner chamber, and the last in the outer
hall. The time occupied is from two to four hours,
and the operation is repeated once a week.</p>

<p>On raising the curtain which covers the entrance to
the street, you find yourself in a hall circular, octagonal,
or square, covered with a dome open in the
centre: it may be one hundred feet in height; the
Pantheon of Rome may be taken as a model. This
is the <dfn>apodyterium</dfn>, <dfn>conclave</dfn> or <dfn>spoliatorium</dfn> of the
Romans. In the middle, a basin of water, the “sea”
of the Jews, the “piscinum” of the Romans, is raised
by masonry about four feet; a fountain plays in the
centre. Plants, sometimes trellises, are trained over
or around the fountain, and by it is placed the stall
to supply coffee, pipes, or nargelles. All round there
is a platform, varying in breadth from four to twelve
feet, and raised about three; here couches are placed,
which I shall presently describe. You are conducted
to an unoccupied couch to undress; your clothes are
folded and deposited in a napkin and tied up; you
are arrayed in the bathing costume, which consists
of three towels about two yards long and under a
yard in width, thickened in the centre with pendant
loops of the thread, so as to absorb the moisture, soft
and rough without being flabby or hard, with broad
borders in blue or red of raw silk. This gives to this
costume an air of society, and takes from it the stamp
of the laundry or wash-house. One is wrapped with
an easy fold round the head, so as to form a high and
peculiar, but not ungraceful turban; the second is
bound round the loins, and falls to the middle of the
leg; this is the ordinary costume of the attendants
in the bath, and appears to be the costume known
in antiquity as <ins title="perizôma" lang="el">περίζωμα</ins>, <dfn>præcinctorium</dfn>,
and <dfn>subligaculum</dfn>,
and which have been of difficult interpretation,
as implying at once a belt and a clothing. The
third is thrown over the shoulder like a scarf: they
are called <dfn>Pistumal</dfn>, as are all towels, but the proper
name is <dfn>Futa</dfn>, a word borrowed, as the stuff is, from
Morocco. While you change your linen, two attendants
hold a cloth before you. In these operations, which
appear to dispense of necessity with clothing and
concealment, the same scrupulous attention is observed.
It extends to the smallest children. I have
been on a bathing excursion to the sea-side, where
a child under four years was disappointed of his
dip because his bathing drawers had been forgotten.
There is nothing which more shocks an Eastern than
our want of decorum; and I have known instances
of servants assigning this as a reason for refusing to
remain in Europe, or to come to it.</p>

<p>Thus attired, you step down from the platform
height; wooden pattens,—<dfn>nalma</dfn> in Turkish, <dfn>cob cob</dfn>
in Arabic,—are placed for your feet, to keep you off
the hot floors, and the dirty water running off by the
entrances and passages; two attendants take you, one
by each arm above the elbow—walking behind and
holding you. The slamming doors are pushed open,
and you enter the region of steam.</p>

<p>Each person is preceded by a mattress and a cushion,
which are removed the moment he has done with them,
that they may not get damp. The apartment he now
enters is low and small; very little light is admitted;
sometimes, indeed, the day is excluded, and the small
flicker of a lamp enables you to perceive indistinctly
its form and occupants. The temperature is moderate,
the moisture slight, the marble floor on both sides is
raised about eighteen inches, the lower and centre part
being the passage between the two halls. This is the
<dfn>tepidarium</dfn>. Against the wall your mattress and
cushion are placed, the rest of the chamber being
similarly occupied: the attendants now bring coffee,
and serve pipes. The object sought in this apartment
is a natural and gentle flow of perspiration; to this
are adapted the subdued temperature and moisture;
for this the clothing is required, and the coffee and
pipe; and, in addition, a delicate manipulation is
undergone, which does not amount to shampooing:
the sombre air of the apartment calms the senses, and
shuts out the external
world.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_25"></a><a href="#footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>During the subsequent parts of the operation, you
are either too busy or too abstracted for society; the
bath is essentially sociable, and this is the portion
of it so appropriated—this is the time and place where
a stranger makes acquaintance with a town or village.
Whilst so engaged, a boy kneels at your feet and
chafes them, or behind your cushion, at times touching
or tapping you on the neck, arm, or shoulder, in a
manner which causes the perspiration to start.</p>

<p><i>2nd Act.</i>—You now take your turn for entering the
inner chamber: there is in this point no respect for
persons, and rank gives no
precedence,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_26"></a><a href="#footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></span> but you do
not move until the bathman, the <dfn>tellack</dfn> of the Turks,
the <dfn>nekaës</dfn> of the Arabs, the <dfn>tractator</dfn> of the Romans,
has passed his hand under your bathing linen, and is
satisfied that your skin is in a proper state. He then
takes you by the arm as before, your feet are again
pushed into the pattens, the slamming door of the
inner region is pulled back, and you are ushered into
the <dfn>adytum</dfn>,—a space such as the centre dome of a
cathedral, filled—not with dull and heavy steam—but
with gauzy and mottled vapour, through which the
spectre-like inhabitants appear, by the light of tinted
rays, which, from stars of stained glass in the vault,
struggle to reach the pavement, through the curling
mists. The song, the not unfrequent shout, the clapping,
not of hands, but
sides;<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_27"></a><a href="#footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></span> the splashing of water
and clank of brazen bowls reveals the humour and
occupation of the inmates, who, here divested of all
covering save the scarf round the loins, with no distinction
between bathers and attendants, and with
heads as bare as bodies and legs, are seen passing to
and fro through the mist, or squatted or stretched
out on the slabs, exhibiting the wildest contortions,
or bending over one another, and appearing to inflict
and to endure torture. A stranger might be in doubt
whether he beheld a foundry or Tartarus; whether
the Athenian gymnasia were restored, or he had entered
some undetected vault of the Inquisition. That
is the <dfn>sudatorium</dfn>. The steam is raised by throwing
water on the floor,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_28"></a><a href="#footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></span>
and its clearness comes from
the equal temperature of the air and walls.</p>

<p>Under the dome there is an extensive platform of
marble slabs: on this you get up; the clothes are taken
from your head and shoulders; one is spread for you
to lie on, the other is rolled for your head; you lie
down on your back; the tillak (two, if the operation
is properly performed) kneels at your side, and bending
over, gripes and presses your chest, arms, and legs, passing
from part to part, like a bird shifting its place on a
perch. He brings his whole weight on you with a jerk,
follows the line of muscle with anatomical
thumb,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_29"></a><a href="#footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></span>
draws the open hand strongly over the surface, particularly
round the shoulder, turning you half up in so
doing; stands with his feet on the thighs and on the
chest and slips down the ribs; then up again three
times; and lastly, doubling your arms one after the
other on the chest, pushes with both hands down, beginning
at the elbow, and then, putting an arm under
the back and applying his chest to your crossed elbows,
rolls on you across till you crack. You are now turned
on your face, and, in addition to the operation above
described, he works his elbow round the edges of
your shoulder-blade, and with the heel plies hard the
angle of the neck; he concludes by hauling the body
half up by each arm successively, while he stands with
one foot on the opposite
thigh.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_30"></a><a href="#footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></span>
You are then raised
for a moment to a sitting posture, and a contortion
given to the small of the back with the knee, and a
jerk to the neck by the two hands holding the temples.</p>

<p><i>3rd Act.</i>—Round the sides there are cocks for
hot and cold water over marble basins, a couple of
feet in diameter, where you mix to the temperature
you wish. You are now seated on a board on the
floor at one of these fountains, with a copper
cup<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_31"></a><a href="#footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></span> to
throw water over you when wanted. The <dfn>tellak</dfn> puts
on the glove—it is of camel’s hair, not the horrid
things recently brought forth in England. He stands
over you; you bend down to him, and he commences
from the nape of the neck in long sweeps down the
back till he has started the skin; he coaxes it into
rolls, keeping them in and up till within his hand they
gather volume and length; he then successively strikes
and brushes them away, and they fall right and left as
if spilt from a dish of macaroni. The dead matter
which will accumulate in a week forms, when dry,
a ball of the size of the fist. I once collected it, and
had it dried—it is like a ball of chalk: this was
the purpose for which the <dfn>strigil</dfn> was used. In our
ignorance we have imagined it to be a horse-scraper to
clear off the perspiration, or for other purposes equally
absurd.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_32"></a><a href="#footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></span></p>

<p><i>4th Act.</i>—Hitherto soap has not touched the skin.
By it, however strange it may appear to
us,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_33"></a><a href="#footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></span> the
operation would be spoiled—the shampooing would
be impossible, and the epidermis would not come off;
this I know by experience. The explanation may be,
that the alkali of the soap combines chemically with
the oily matter, and the epidermis loses the consistency
it must have to be detached by rolling. A large
wooden bowl is now brought; in it is a lump of soap
with a sort of powder-puff of
<dfn>liff</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_34"></a><a href="#footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></span> for lathering. Beginning
by the head, the body is copiously soaped
and washed twice, and part of the contents of the
bowl is left for you to conclude and complete the
operation yourself. Then approaches an acolyte, with
a pile of hot folded <dfn>futas</dfn> on his head, he holding a
dry cloth spread out in front—you rise, having detached
the cloth from your waist, and holding it before
you: at that moment another attendant dashes on you
a bowl of hot water. You drop your wet cloth; the
dry one is passed round your waist, another over your
shoulders; each arm is seized; you are led a step or
two and seated; the shoulder cloth is taken off, another
put on, the first over it; another is folded round the
head; your feet are already in the wooden pattens.
You are wished health; you return the salute, rise,
and are conducted by both arms to the outer hall.</p>

<p>I must not here omit all mention of an interlude
in which Europeans take no part. The Mussulmans
get rid of superfluous hair by shaving or
depilation.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_35"></a><a href="#footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></span>
The depilatory is composed of orpiment and
quick lime, called in Turkish <dfn>ot</dfn>, in Arabic <dfn>dewa</dfn>.
The bather retires to a cell without door, but at
the entrance of which he suspends his waist towel;
the bath-man brings him a razor, if he prefers it, or
a lump of the <dfn>ot</dfn> about the size of a walnut. In two
or three minutes after applying it the hair is ready
to come off, and a couple of bowls of water leave the
skin entirely bare, not without a flush from the corrosiveness
of the
preparation.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_36"></a><a href="#footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>The platform round the hall is raised and divided
by low balustrades into little compartments, where
the couches of repose are arranged, so that while
having the uninterrupted view all round, parties or
families may be by themselves. This is the time and
place for meals. The bather having reached this
apartment is conducted to the edge of the platform,
to which there is only one high step. You drop
the wooden patten, and on the matting a towel is
spread anticipating your foot-fall. The couch is in
the form of a letter
M.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_37"></a><a href="#footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></span> spread out, and as you rest
on it the weight is everywhere directly supported—every
tendon, every muscle is relaxed; the mattress
fitting, as it were, into the skeleton: there is total
inaction, and the body appears to be
suspended.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_38"></a><a href="#footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></span>
The attendants then re-appear, and gliding like noiseless
shadows, stand in a row before you. The coffee
is poured out and presented: the pipe follows; or,
if so disposed, you may have sherbet or fruit; the
sweet or water melons are preferred, and they come
in piles of lumps large enough for a mouthful; or you
may send and get kebobs on a skewer; and if inclined
to make a positive meal at the bath, this is
the time.</p>

<p>The hall is open to the heavens, but nevertheless
a boy with a fan of feathers, or a napkin, drives the
cool air upon you. The Turks have given up the cold
immersion of the Romans, yet so much as this they
have retained of it, and which realizes the end which
the Romans had in view to prevent the after breaking
out of the perspiration; but it is still a practice
amongst the Turks to have cold water thrown upon
the feet. The nails of hands and feet are dexterously
pared with a sort of oblique chisel; any callosities
that remain on the feet are rubbed down:
during this time the linen is twice
changed.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_39"></a><a href="#footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></span> These
operations do not interrupt the chafing of the
soles,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_40"></a><a href="#footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></span>
and the gentle putting on of the outside of the folds of
linen which I have mentioned in the first stage. The
body has come forth shining like alabaster, fragrant
as the cistus, sleek as satin, and soft as velvet. The
touch of your own skin is electric. Buffon has a
wonderful description of Adam’s surprise and delight
at his first touch of himself. It is the description
of the human sense when the body is brought back
to its purity. The body thus renewed, the spirit
wanders abroad, and reviewing its tenement rejoices
to find it clean and tranquil. There is an intoxication
or dream that lifts you out of the flesh, and yet
a sense of life and consciousness that spreads through
every member. Each breastful of air seems to pass,
not to the heart but to the brain, and to quench, not
the pulsations of the one, but the fancies of the other.
That exaltation which requires the slumber of the
senses—that vividness of sense that drowns the visions
of the spirit—are simultaneously engaged in calm and
unspeakable luxury: you condense the pleasures of
many scenes, and enjoy in an hour the existence of
years.</p>

<p>But “this too will
pass.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_41"></a><a href="#footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></span> The visions fade, the
speed of the blood thickens, the breath of the pores
is checked, the crispness of the skin returns, the fountains
of strength are opened; you seek again the
world and its toils; and those who experience these
effects and vicissitudes for the first time exclaim, “I
feel as if I could leap over the moon.” Paying
your pence according to the tariff of your deserts,
you walk forth a king from the gates which you
had entered a beggar.</p>

<p>This chief of luxuries is common, in a barbarous
land and under a despotism, to every man, woman,
and child; to the poorest as to the richest, and to the
richest no otherwise and no better than to the
poorest.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_42"></a><a href="#footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></span>
But how is it paid for? How can it be within
the reach of the poor? They pay according to their
means. What each person gives is put into a common
stock; the box is opened once a week, and the distribution
of the contents is made according to a scale:
the master of the bath comes in for his share just
like the rest. A person of distinction will give a
pound or more; the common price that, at Constantinople,
a tradesman would pay, was from tenpence
to a shilling, workmen from twopence to threepence.
In a village near Constantinople, where I spent some
months, the charge for men was a
halfpenny,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_43"></a><a href="#footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></span> for
women three farthings. A poor person will lay down
a few parahs to show that he has not more to give,
and where the poor man is so treated he will give
as much as he can. He will not, like the poor Roman,
have access alone, but his cup of coffee and a portion
of the service like the
rest.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_44"></a><a href="#footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></span> Such rules are not to
be established, but such habits may be destroyed by
laws.</p>

<p>This I have observed, that wherever the bath is
used it is not confined to any class of the community,
as if it was felt to be too good a thing to be
denied to any.</p>

<p>I must now conduct the reader into the Moorish
bath. First, there was no bath linen. They go in naked.
Then there is but one room, under which there is an
oven, and a pot, open into the bath, is boiling on the
fire below. There were no pattens—the floor burning
hot—so we got boards. At once the operation commenced,
which is analogous to the glove. There was a
dish of gazule, for the shampooer to rub his hands in.
I was seated on the board, with my legs straight out
before me; the shampooer seated himself on the same
board behind me, stretching out his legs. He then
made me close my fingers upon the toes of his feet,
by which he got a purchase against me, and rubbing
his hands in the gazule, commenced upon the middle
of my back, with a sharp motion up and down, between
beating and rubbing, his hands working in
opposite directions. After rubbing in this way the
back, he pulled my arms through his own and through
each other, twisting me about in the most extraordinary
manner, and drawing his fingers across the
region of the diaphragm, so as to make me, a practised
bather, shriek. After rubbing in this way the
skin, and stretching at the same time the joints of
my upper body, he came and placed himself at my
feet, dealing with my legs in like manner. Then
thrice taking each leg and lifting it up, he placed his
head under the calf, and raising himself, scraped the
leg as with a rough brush, for his shaved head had
the grain downwards. The operation concluded by
his biting my heel.</p>

<p>The bath becomes a second nature, and long privation
so increases the zest, that I was not disposed to
be critical; but, if by an effort of the imagination I
could transport the Moorish bath to Constantinople,
and had then to choose between the hamâm of Eshi
Serai or my own at home, and this one of the Moors, I
must say, I never should see the inside of a Moorish
bath again. It certainly does clear off the epidermis,
work the flesh, excite the skin, set at work the
absorbent and exuding vessels, raise the temperature,
apply moisture;—but the refinements and
luxuries are wanting.</p>

<p>A great deal of learning has been expended upon
the baths of the ancients, and a melancholy exhibition
it is—so much acuteness and research, and no
profit. The details of these wonderful structures, the
evidences of their usefulness, have prompted no prince,
no people of Europe to imitate them, and so acquire
honour for the one, health for the other. The writers,
indeed, present not living practices, but cold and
ill-assorted details, as men must do who profess to
describe what they themselves do not comprehend.
From what I have said, the identity of the Turkish
bath, with that of the Romans, will be at once
perceived, and the apparent discrepancies and differences
explained. The <dfn>apodyterium</dfn> is the <dfn>mustaby</dfn>
or entrance-hall; after this comes the sweating-apartment,
subdivided by difference of degrees. Then
two operations are performed, shampooing, and the
clearing off of the epidermis. The Romans had in
the <dfn>tepidarium</dfn> and the <dfn>sudatorium</dfn> distinct attendants
for the two operations; the first shampooer
receiving the appropriate name of <dfn>tractator</dfn>; the
others, who used the strigil, which was equivalent to
the glove, being called <dfn>suppetones</dfn>. The appearance of
the strigil in no way alters the character of the
operation. They used sponges also for rubbing down,
like the Moorish gazule. They used no soap; neither
do the Moors;—the Turks use it after the operation
is concluded. The <dfn>Laconicum</dfn> I understood when I
saw the Moorish bath, with the pot of water, heated
from the fire below, boiling up into the bath. I
then recollected that there is in the Turkish baths an
opening, by which the steam from the boilers can be
let in, although not frequently so used, nor equally
placed within observation. Many of the Turkish
baths have, doubtless, been originally Greek. The
change in respect to the use of cold water is compensated
for<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_45"></a><a href="#footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></span>
by the cold air of the outer room, into
which the Turks come, and is preserved in the partial
use of cold water for the feet. The hot-water reservoirs,
the <dfn>labrum</dfn> and <dfn>solium</dfn>, are still to be seen
in the private baths; they are in those of the Alhambra.
When used, the character of running water,
an essential point among the Turks, is given to them,
by a hole being left below, which is unplugged, and
a stream kept running in above from a cock. It
would appear that the Romans followed the same
method. The <dfn>piscinum</dfn> of the Romans is found in
the Moorish gardens. In the use of depilatories, or
the shaving off the hair, the practice of the Turks
is exactly that of the Romans; the parts of the bath
appropriated to that purpose being the same. The
<dfn>olearea</dfn> are alone wanting. The Mussulmans would
consider this smearing of the body with oil or ointments
not as a part of the bath, but a defilement, for
which the purification of the bath was
requisite.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_46"></a><a href="#footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>The Romans used the bath to excess, taking it
daily; the Mussulmans restricted its use to once
a-week. The Romans entered the bath naked; the
Mussulmans have introduced a bathing costume; the
Romans allowed the two sexes to enter promiscuously,
the Mussulmans have wholly separated them. Preserving
the good, they have purified it from excesses,
which, to a people of less discrimination, might have
appeared to constitute its essential characters, or to be
entailed as its necessary consequences. Our studies
and learning have furnished us with no such results.
These very excesses have been assigned as a reason for
the disuse of the bath by the early Christians. If
the explanation were true, the difference between the
Christians and the Mussulmans would amount to this,
that the first could see and reject the evil, the second
perceive and select the good.</p>

<p>There is one point connected with the bath on
which I must say a few words, especially as in this
case our usages do not present any obstacle to the
adoption of a good habit, and I have repeatedly had
the gratification of finding that the suggestions which
follow were of use.</p>

<p>Those who wash the rest of their body, often
except the head;—the practice of smearing it with
oil almost universally prevails. The Easterns do the
reverse—they shave it. A greater comfort there cannot
be than a bald pate. Washing the head is in no case
prejudicial. Unless you wash the head, the washing
of the body is neither complete nor satisfactory: the
refreshment of washing the head may often be procured
when it is impossible to wash the body. Soap
and water are injurious, not to the hair, but to the
hair-dressers. The men in the East have no hair to
show, but if soap and water injure the hair, whence
comes the luxuriant abundance of that of the women?
The hair of the head, like the fur of animals, is made
to bear rain and wind, and to be a protection against
them. You cover it up! The fur of animals thickens
and strengthens when exposed to air and wet. Your
hair falls off, and you oil it. If it grows weak, change
its habits. If it is not washed, and if it is oiled, begin
to wash it, and leave off oiling it.</p>

<p>Every week an Eastern lady has her hair thoroughly
washed at the bath. It is first well soaped and rubbed.
They are very particular about soap, and use none but
that made of olive oil. The Castile soap, which in this
country is sold at the apothecary’s, is the soap the
least injurious to the skin. This is twice repeated.
After the soap, they apply a paste of Armenian bole
and rose-leaves. This is rubbed into the roots of the
hair, and left to imbibe all the grease of the head;
it is then, like the soap, washed off with bowls of hot
water, and leaves the locks perfectly clean and silken.
From time to time they dye it. On these occasions
an attendant mixes up a handful of henna-dust in hot
water, and thoroughly smears with it the hair, which
is then turned up into a ball and bound tightly with
a napkin. In this state they go through the bath.
When the napkin is removed, and the henna-paste
washed out, the hair, if before black, will have become
of a bronze auburn, and if grey, red. The bath
occupies from three to four hours, with the smoking,
chatting, music, and dancing, which accompany it, in
an atmosphere that excludes every unpleasant sensation.
The women are not, like the men, contented
with the bathing-linen and apparatus, which they
find there; but are followed by female slaves, who
bear bundles of towels in silk and satin wrappers,
boxwood pattens, incrusted with mother of pearl,
silver basins and bowls, or sometimes enamelled ones,
and aloe-wood and ambergris to perfume both the
apartment and their coffee. This finery is less than
what they indulge in in their private baths.</p>

<p>The Romans and Greeks, in like manner, were
accompanied by their slaves, and did not trust to the
service of the <dfn>thermæ</dfn>. Each person brought his strigil
and his anointing vase (strigilis et
ampulla, <ins title="lêkythos kai xystra" lang="el">λήκυθος καὶ ξύστρα</ins>),<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_47"></a><a href="#footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></span>
or sent them by his slave. The practice
furnishes the familiar metaphors which express the
different conditions.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_48"></a><a href="#footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></span>
The strigil was the sign of
comfort, and also of sobriety and industry. It was,
according to Cicero, necessary to the happiness of the
Roman citizen; it had to do with the fortunes of the
Roman state. Rome was indebted to her strigil as
well as her sword for the conquest of the world.</p>

<p>This constant washing occasions, it may be supposed,
an enormous waste of water. A Turk uses
less water than an English gentleman. It is true,
every Turk, high and low, uses the same quantity,
and washes in the same manner; but the utensils and
conveniences are differently adapted. There are no
wash-hand basins and ewers in bedrooms, no foot-pans,
hip-baths, shower-baths, &amp;c. They do not dabble
in dirty water, defiling a great quantity. They wash
under a stream of water, running from a fountain,
urn, or ewer. A handful serves to moisten the soap
and to rub with it, and a couple more rinse it completely
off. The fountains are placed in the passages,
staircases, &amp;c. By the mosques, and in the
streets, they are so arranged that, by sitting on a step,
you can wash the feet and the head. When you wash
in a room, one attendant brings the basin, <dfn>laen</dfn>, with
its pierced cover and kneels before you; another the
ewer, <dfn>ibrik</dfn>, with its long, narrow neck to pour the
water.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_49"></a><a href="#footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></span>
In the bath, steam and perspiration cleanse,
and two or three large saucerfuls suffice for rinsing;—fifty
persons may be bathed with the water that
serves to fill our trough for washing one.</p>

<p>What a difference it makes in domestic comfort to
be certain that every person around you, and every
thing you touch and eat are absolutely clean! After
this manner of life, the habits of Europe are most
painful: you are constantly oppressed with the touch,
or sight, or knowledge of things which, by the European,
are not considered clean, and submitted to as
unavoidable. It would but faintly describe my impressions
to say, that I felt as if passing from a
refined to a rude condition of society. Neither do we
know how to cultivate or handle the body. One of
the first thoughts was, “What shall I do in sickness?”
All Europe’s seductions and luxuries put together will
not make up for this one.</p>

<p>The European is clean, in so far as he is so, for
appearance; he has clothes and shoe-brushes, blacking,
starch, smoothing-irons, &amp;c.; in these consist his
<em>neatness</em>.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_50"></a><a href="#footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></span>
The clean shirt is put upon the dirty
body; the hands and face being alone open to the air
and sun and the eyes of the neighbours, are washed.
Nothing is filthy that is
unseen.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_51"></a><a href="#footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></span> The Eastern has
no brush or blacking; no care is expended or expense
incurred for neatness. He has his religious ablutions
for prayer.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_52"></a><a href="#footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></span>
He will not tell you that he washes

<p>Whatever proceeds from the body is impure; to

If by act or accident
the Mussulman is rendered unclean he has to wash
himself. The soiling of his carpet may entail the
ablution of the whole body; while it remains unperformed
he is <i lang="la">ipso facto</i> excommunicated—can take
part in no ceremony, say no prayer. He is strictly
in the scriptural sense “unclean.” All injunctions
of the same sort are in like manner enforced. These
are the first lessons taught the child, and become a
second nature; and, re-acting on the belief from which
they spring, give to it that surprising hold over the
mind. They pass through life, generation after generation,
without probably a single instance of the infringement
of rules brought into operation every hour
of the day.</p>

which serve for resort, shade, repose, or
retreat.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_55"></a><a href="#footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></span> In
“Hadji Baba” is a ludicrous account of the perplexities
of a Persian in one of the modern adaptations of civilization
to cleanliness—his ineffectual attempts to get
at the gushing water, his inability to work the machinery
or comprehend the purpose. In that part
of their house there is a water-cock for use. The
flooring is of marble—the water falls and runs, and
high wooden pattens are used. The outer cloth garments
are left outside—the ample sleeves are tucked
up. If there be no fixed pipe a ewer is at hand,
and a servant waits outside with basin, ewer, and
napkin. In consequence of the offices attached to
every mosque, their cities do not present offensive
smells, disgusting filth and revolting indecency. One
hand is set apart for noble, the other for ignoble
service. The left hand on its dying day has not so
much as touched the mouth; the right is in equal
ignorance of other parts of the body. This is the
natural sense of the words: “Let not thy right hand
know what thy left hand
doeth.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_56"></a><a href="#footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>I have not hesitated to allude to matters which
our false refinement forbids to mention, and thus the
sensibility given us to put away what is impure is
diverted merely to its concealment. The reader must
fill up this faint sketch from his imagination, and
when he has done so, he will understand why an
Eastern cannot endure Europe, and why Christians
amongst Mussulmans are called
“dogs.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_57"></a><a href="#footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>Why should the ladies of the East have enjoyments
from which ours are debarred, and sensations too of
which they know nothing? It may be said the
Turkish ladies so make up for their “exclusion from
society:”—they have no balls or operas, morning
concerts or fancy fairs, and therefore they take up
with these merely sensual indulgences. They would
no more exchange their bath for your balls, than you
would your balls for a Yankee camp-meeting. There
is no necessity for exchange. Why not have both?
Would it be no comfort, no pleasure, no benefit to
an English lady, on returning from a ball, and before
going to bed, to be able, divested of whalebone and
crinoline, and robed as an Atalanta, to enter marble
chambers with mosaic floors, and be refreshed and
purified from the toil she has undergone, and prepared
for the soft enjoyment of the rest she seeks?
The hanging gardens of Babylon were devised by
the love of Nature of a Median woman; the palaces
and groves of the Azahra laid out by the taste of
a Numidian:—why should not England owe to the
delicacy of an
Englishwoman<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_58"></a><a href="#footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></span>
the restoration of the
<dfn>thermæ</dfn>?</p>

<p>Our intercourse with the lower orders is broken off
by there being no settled occasion on which we are
in contact with them, and by the want of cleanliness
in their persons. Here both classes are constantly
brought into the presence of each other. Contempt
and distaste are removed on one side, degradation
and irritation on the other: they know one another:
the intercourse of various ranks requires and sustains
a style and demeanour which strike all Europeans,
who are astonished that the bearing of the
peasant is as courtly as that of the Pasha: he is as
clean as the Pasha. Think of a country where difference
of rank makes no difference of cleanliness!
What must Easterns think of us where the difference
of condition can be traced—in speech, manner,
and washing. The bath is of as great value to the
society as to the individual. A political economist,
glorifying his age, exclaims—“Augustus in all his
splendour had neither glass for his window nor a
shirt to his back.” The slave and the beggar in
Rome were daily in the enjoyment of luxuries which
no European monarch knows.</p>

<p>There is an impression that the bath is weakening.
We can test this in three ways; its effects
on those debilitated by disease, on those exhausted
by fatigue, and on those who are long exposed
to it.</p>

<p>1. In affection of the lungs and intermittent fever,
the bath is invariably had recourse to against the
debilitating nightly perspirations. The temperature
is kept low, not to increase the action of the heart
or the secretions; this danger avoided, its effect is
to subdue by a healthy perspiration in a waking
state the unhealthy one in sleep. No one ever heard
of any injury from the bath. The moment a person
is ailing he is hurried off to it.</p>

<p>2. After long and severe fatigue—that fatigue such
as we never know—successive days and nights on
horseback—the bath affords the most astonishing
relief. Having performed long journeys on horseback,
even to the extent of ninety-four hours, without
taking rest, I know by experience its effects in
the extremest cases.</p>

<p>A Tartar, having an hour to rest, prefers a bath to
sleep. He enters as if drugged with opium, and leaves
it, his senses cleared, and his strength restored as much
as if he had slept for several hours. This is not to
be attributed to the heat or moisture alone, but to
the shampooing, which in such cases is of an extraordinary
nature. The Tartar sits down and doubles
himself up; the shampooer (and he selects the most
powerful man) then springs with his feet on his
shoulders, cracking his vertebræ; with all his force
and weight he pummels the whole back, and then
turning him on his back and face, aided by a second
shampooer, tramples on his body and limbs: the
Tartar then lays himself down for half an hour;
and, perhaps, though that is not necessary, sleeps.
Well can I recall the hamâm doors which I have
entered, scarcely able to drag one limb after the other,
and from which I have sprung into my saddle again,
elastic as a sinew and light as a feather.</p>

<p>You will see a <dfn>Hammal</dfn> (porter), a man living
only on rice, go out of one of those baths where he
has been pouring with that perspiration which we think
must prostrate and weaken, and take up his load of
five hundred-weight, placing it unaided on his back.</p>

<p>3. The shampooers spend eight hours daily in the
steam; they undergo great labour there, shampooing,
perhaps, a dozen persons, and are remarkably
healthy. They enter the bath at eight years of age:
the duties of the younger portion are light, and chiefly
outside in the hall to which the bathers retire after
the bath; still, there they are from that tender age
exposed to the steam and heat, so as to have their
strength broken, if the bath were debilitating. The
best shampooer under whose hands I have ever been,
was a man whose age was given me as ninety, and
who, from eight years of age, had been daily eight
hours in the bath. This was at the natural baths
of Sophia. I might adduce in like manner the sugar-bakers
in London, who in a temperature not less
than that of the bath, undergo great fatigue, and are
also remarkably healthy.</p>

<p>The Romans furnish another example. Unlike the
Arabs, who restrict its use to once a week, they went
into it daily. The temperature was gradually raised,
until in the time of Nero it came to be excessive.
Their habits in other respects were not such as to
be conducive to health, and must have disqualified
them for enduring the bath: if it did debilitate, it
served therefore as an antidote to their manner of
life, and relieved the excess of the Patrician, as it
does to-day the fatigue of the Tartar.</p>

<p>Life is chemical and galvanic, but both these agencies
result in, and depend upon, motion: the vessels
are constructed for conveying fluids, the muscles for
generating power. Thus, shampooing exerts over the
human body a power analogous to that of drugs administered
by the mouth. A blow which kills, a posture
which benumbs;—pressure, which in long disease
becomes a chief obstacle to recovery, exercise which
gives health and strength—are all evidences of the
influence of motion over our system.</p>

<p>Who has not experienced in headaches and other
pains, relief from the most unartful rubbing? You
receive a blow, and involuntarily rub the part. Cold
will kill; the remedy is brandy and friction. The
resources of this process surely deserve to be developed
with as much care as that which has been bestowed
upon the Materia Medica. Where practised,
human suffering is relieved, obstructions are removed,
indigestion is cured, paralysis and diseases of the spine,
&amp;c., arising from the loss of muscular power, are within
its reach, while they are not under the control of
our medicines. Here is a new method to add to
the old. Wherever it can be employed, how much
is it to be preferred to nauseating substances taken
into the stomach; how much must the common practice
of it tend to preserve the vitality of the whole
frame! Even if disregarded as an enjoyment of health,
it offers a solace which ought to be invaluable in the
eye of a medical man, as of course it must be of the
patient. We have all to play that part.</p>

<p>Where the practice is familiar, it is used not merely
in the bath, but upon all occasions. It is to be
found without the bath, as among the Hindoos, some
Tartar tribes, the Chinese, and the Sandwich islands:—the
latter presents one of the most remarkable of
phenomena. The different ranks are those of different
stature. The chiefs are sunk in sloth and
immorality; and yet it is not they, who, like the
grandees of Spain, are the diminutive and decrepit
race;—they are
shampooed.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_59"></a><a href="#footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></span> A practice which our
epicures and our stoics, our patients and our doctors,
would turn up the nose at, counteracts the
consequences of gluttony, intoxication, debauchery,
and sloth, and supplies the place of exercise and
temperance; and a people which can boast no school
of philosophy, whose nostrils have never been regaled
by the compounds of Beauvilliers, and whose
pulse has never been stretched out to a Halden, is
able to combine the health of the Brahmin with the
indulgence of the Sybarite, and the frame of the
gymnast with the habits of the hog.</p>

<p>Turner in his Embassy to Thibet, (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 84), describes
the gylong or class of priests, as “more athletic”
than their countrymen, although they “lead a life
in an extreme degree sedentary and recluse.” They
perform ablutions in which their compatriots do not
join. The physical superiority of the aristocracy of
England may be owing to a similar cause, cleanliness
being with us a mark of station.</p>

<p>In Denmark, shampooing has recently been hit upon
as a scientific process, and a college has been instituted,
as I understand, with considerable success, for
the practice of what they are pleased to call <dfn>medicina
mechanica</dfn>.</p>

<p>What am I to say of our medical science, what of
our medical practitioners, what of our philanthropy,
what of our selfishness, in not having the bath as a
means of curing disease?<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_60"></a><a href="#footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></span>
Never was a people more
heroically self-denying or extravagantly insensate.
We must love the racking of pain, the flavour of drugs,
and the totals of apothecaries’ bills; for with our
classical acquirements and love of travel, we cannot
be ignorant, that all maladies, with the exception of
epidemical ones, were less common in Rome than in
modern London, notwithstanding our many advantages
from the improved state of medical knowledge;
and that several painful diseases common amongst us
were exceedingly rare amongst the ancients, and are
almost unknown in Mahometan countries. There are
those who are of opinion that contagious disorders,
“dreadful scourges of the human race, might never
have taken root, nor if they had, would now be spread
so widely, had the hot bath been in use amongst
us.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_61"></a><a href="#footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>The human body is formed for labour, and requires
it, and this labour is accompanied by perspiration.
It is the safety-valve for the heart, the sewer for
the secretions; the scavenger for the skin. Those
who are thrown repeatedly into perspiration, possess,
however seldom washed, many advantages over those
who have not to undergo severe bodily toil, however
often they may use soap and water to the surface.</p>

<p>The bath substitutes an artificial and easy perspiration,
and this explains the extraordinary fact,
that the people who use it do not require exercise
for health, and can pass from the extreme of indolence
to that of toil.</p>

<p>The functions for carrying on life are of the
nature of a steam-engine, and a chemical apparatus:
lethal gases are given forth as from a furnace;
poisons are produced by every organ; from every
function there is residuum, and the body, while
soiled by labour, is rusted by repose. This rust, this
residuum deposits on the skin.</p>

<p>The extremities of the vessels become charged
with unctuous matter; the deadened cellules of the
epidermis are covered with a varnish, which is partly
insoluble in water, and this internal accumulation
and external coating prevent the skin from performing
its functions, which are not confined to those
of shielding the body, but are essential to the
chemical processes within. The skin has analogous
duties to those of the lungs, supplying oxygen to the
blood at the extremity of its course, and when most
completely in need of it. It has to aid at the same
time the action of the heart. In its health is their
health, and its health is cleanliness. Unlike the two
other organs, it is placed within man’s reach, and
confided to his care; and curiously interspersed through
it are glands secreting peculiar odours, that the
touch and sight shall not alone warn, but a third
sense be enlisted in this guardianship, crying aloud
on every remissness, and charging and reciprocating
every
neglect.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_62"></a><a href="#footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>The Russians come out of a bath of 120° to
roll themselves in the snow. This we explained by
the fervour of the circulation, which enables them
to withstand the shock. If so, the strong and
healthy might bear it—not the weak and suffering,
the octogenarian and the child. The sudden passage
from a Russian
bath<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_63"></a><a href="#footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></span>
to a glacial atmosphere, is
attended by neither shock nor danger; and far from
the oppression that would result from the absorption
of vital action in the efforts of the heart to
overcome the violent contraction of the circulation,
by the cold, there is a sense of ineffable relief.
You seem to take in and throw forth your breath
in mere playfulness, no longer dependent upon it
momentarily for life. In fact, the lungs and heart
are discharged in part from the toil of that unceasing
labour, which, beginning with the cradle, ends
with the grave. Of what service must it not be to
aid a machine, the efforts of which, in the most
delicate girl, are equal to a steam-engine of fourteen
horse-power?<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_64"></a><a href="#footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>Who can reflect on this, and be content with
mere wonder, nor bethink himself of the means
by which the purposes of Nature can be aided, and
the gifts of Providence
enjoyed?<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_65"></a><a href="#footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>The bath has the effect of several classes of
medicines; that is to say, it removes the symptoms
for which they are administered; thus, it is a cathartic,
a diuretic, a tonic, a detersive, a narcotic; but
the effect is produced only when there is cause.
It will bring sleep to the patient suffering from insomnia,
but will not, like opium, make the healthy
man drowsy; and relieve constipation without bringing
on the healthy—as aloes would—diarrhœa: it is
thus a drug, which administers itself according to
the need, and brings no after-consequences.</p>

<p>The opium-like effect has often been remarked,
and I have repeatedly experienced after the bath sensations
like those it produces. If it has not the
same power in relieving bodily pain, it has unquestionably
that of assuaging mental suffering. It is
quite as natural an impulse amongst Easterns, to
seek the bath when they are labouring under affliction
as when disposed to give way to gladness. And
this may be considered as one part of its curative
virtues, having the faculty of calming the disturbed
spirit without extinguishing, and indeed while increasing,
the dispositions to cheerfulness.</p>

<p>Reader! consider that this is not a drug in a
shop, to be exhibited by prescription after a visit
to a patient. It would be something if I suggested
a new simple, or an improved plan of administering
a known remedy in any one disorder. It would
be much by such a suggestion to diminish in a few
cases the pains of sciatica or of rheumatism, the tortures
of gout or stone; what I suggest, is a <em>habit</em>,
one which shall become, when adopted, that of the
whole people.</p>

<p>A bath might be had for one quarter of the price
of a glass of gin; for we have water in more abundance,
and at a cheaper rate than at Rome.</p>

<p>To substantiate this estimate, I prepared some
calculations, but having visited the baths and washhouses
recently established, I find the case illustrated
to my hand by practice, and affording an entire
confirmation of all, and more than all, that I have
said. It is not long since that there was not a hot
bath to be got in London under two shillings; what
would then have been said if any one had had the
hardihood to advance, that hot baths might be got
for two-pence? and that bathing establishments, charging
from one penny for cold baths up to sixpence,
should become profitable concerns? Such nevertheless
is the fact. There is here no new idea, no new process,
no new demands: it has simply been suggested
to build larger establishments, and to throw them
open at a smaller sum; so that we have hitherto been
deprived of these advantages through the partial
blindness of those who have, in as far as they do see,
deplored the blindness of others, not thinking that
probably other films intercepted their own sight.</p>

<p>I will therefore take the result obtained in these
baths and wash-houses, as the basis of the calculation
which I wish to establish. For a thousand
baths, the charge for water varies from twenty to
twenty-eight shillings; the coals for fuel from fifteen
to thirty shillings; the other charges from fifteen
to twenty shillings. In all these cases, the lower
sum is of course above what the charge will be
when experience has pointed out improvements and
economy. Taking the most economical of these establishments,
we have baths at the rate of fifty shillings
a thousand, that is, at a little more than a
halfpenny a piece. The allowance of water for each
bath is forty-five gallons; fuel enters for one-third
into the charge: reducing these charges to what
would be incurred in the Turkish bath, there would
be a saving of eight-ninths for the water, and probably
five-sixths for the fuel, and an entire saving
for the charge of attendance for the poorer classes,
(the <ins title="seautous balneusountes" lang="el">σεαυτοὺς βαλνεύσουντες</ins>);
thus we should have on
the thousand baths, the charge for water and fuel
reduced from thirty-five to five shillings; and the
charge of attendance being withdrawn from the
poorer classes, the expense incurred would amount
to one penny for sixteen baths, or four baths for a
farthing.</p>

<p>Here I am going upon the data supplied by these
bathing establishments, where the water is furnished
to them at a very low price, namely, fifteen shillings
for the one thousand barrels, of thirty gallons, and
where the coals consumed are of an inferior quality,
at nine shillings a ton; and these are the points in
which England and its capital possess such great
advantages. In these establishments they can furnish
between one and two thousand baths a-day, at an
outlay of 15<abbr title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr> or 16<abbr title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr>
a-week; and as the experiment
has so far so well succeeded, two hundred of
them would supply London, at the rate of a bath
to each person, weekly, for which the weekly expenditure
would be 3000<abbr title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr> or 150,000<abbr title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr> per annum,
which would occasion a daily use of 126,000,000 of
gallons of water. In the Turkish manner, the expenditure
of water would be 15,000,000; and taking
the proportionate saving in fuel, there would be a
saving of one half the outlay, or 75,000<abbr title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr> a-year; but,
as the facility thus afforded, and the habits so
engendered, would lead in our climate, and in our
circumstances, to a much more frequent use of the
bath than once a-week, and as it would constantly
be had recourse to by the lower orders, without their
going through the whole process, the establishments
would have to be proportionately larger, and the
expenditure greater. At all events, it is now no
longer a theoretical matter: these baths are in use,
and are extending; and the question is, whether we
shall introduce a perfect instead of a defective
method—an economical instead of an expensive one.
But, if this new charge be incurred, we have, on the
other side, to look forward to the possibility of
retrenchments in consequence of the altered habits of
the people. The one that first presents itself is the
diminution of maladies, doctors’ and apothecaries’ fees
and drugs, loss of time from sickness, and attendance;—and
here, to say nothing of the different value of
life, the saving for London alone will have to be
reckoned by millions. Next are temperance and sobriety.
At first sight the connection will not appear
so immediate; it will, however, be unquestionable to
those familiar with countries where the bath is in use.
I know of no country, in ancient or modern times,
where habits of drunkenness have co-existed with the
bath. Misery and cold drive men to the gin-shop:
if they had the bath—not the washing-tub, but the
sociable hamâm, to repair to—this, the great cause of
drunkenness, would be removed; and if this habit of
cleanliness were general, restraints would be imposed
on such habits by the feelings of self-respect engendered.</p>

<p>Gibbon has indulged in speculations on the consequences
for Europe that would have followed, had
Charles Martel been defeated on the plains of Tours.
One of these effects would have been, that to-day in
London there would be no gin-palaces, and a thousand
baths.</p>

<p>In London and its suburbs there are nearly two
millions of inhabitants; of these, one million and a
half at least cannot afford those baths which we
use.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_66"></a><a href="#footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></span>
Deducting a fifth for infants under forty days old, and
persons confined to bed, there would remain twelve
hundred thousand, so that two hundred thousand
bodies, which now carry their filth from the cradle to
the grave, would be daily washed. Judging by the
scale of prices at Constantinople<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_67"></a><a href="#footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></span>
or Rome, the cost
of a bath might begin from one penny or twopence,
and range upwards to five shillings; striking the
average at sixpence, we should have 5000<abbr title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr> daily, or
1,500,000<abbr title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr> per annum. An ordinary bath will accommodate
two hundred persons daily. At Constantinople,
for a population of five hundred thousand (Turks)
three hundred are requisite. In Cordova, there were
nine hundred; in Alexandria, when taken by the
Arabs, there were four hundred. One thousand baths
would be required for London, and each would have
for its support 1500<abbr title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr> a-year. The cost of erection
would be provided, as for hospitals, churches, &amp;c., by
foundation, donations, bequests, subscriptions, or
municipal charges.</p>

<p>The poor of England have never had an opportunity
of knowing the comfort which is derived on a cold
day from the warmth imparted by such an atmosphere.
How many of the wretched inhabitants of
London go to their chilly homes in the winter months
benumbed with cold, and with no means of recovering
their animal warmth but by resorting to spirits and
a public-house fire. The same sixpence which will
only procure them a quartern of the stimulant, which
imparts but a momentary heat, would, if so expended,
obtain for them at once warmth and refreshment.</p>

<p>Do not run away with the idea that it is Islamism
that prevents the use of spirituous liquors; it is the
bath. It satisfies the cravings which lead to those
indulgencies, it fills the period of necessary relaxation,
and it produces, with cleanliness, habits of self-respect,
which are incompatible with intoxication: it keeps
the families united, which prevents the squandering of
money for such excesses. In Greece and Rome, in
their worst times, there was neither “blue ruin” nor
“double stout.”</p>

<p>The quantity of malt consumed in former days is
referred to as a test of relative well-being. This
I do not deny; but there can be no question that
pure water is the most wholesome
drink,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_68"></a><a href="#footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></span> as it is
unquestionable, that if London were Mussulman, the
operative, as the rest of the population, would bathe
regularly, have a better-dressed dinner for his money,
and prefer water to wine or brandy, gin or beer.
The bath, therefore, would secure at once cleanliness
and temperance.</p>

<p>Where Christianity first appeared, cleanliness, like
charity or hospitality, was a condition of life. Christ
and the apostles went through the legal ablutions.
When the relaxation took place at the first council of
Jerusalem, in favour of the Gentiles, these points
could never have been raised or called in question, for
in this respect the habits of the nations were in
conformity with the Jewish law. Reference is made
to it in the fathers,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_69"></a><a href="#footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></span>
not as a practice only, but as a
duty.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_70"></a><a href="#footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></span>
In the primitive Church of England the
bath was a religious observance: the penitent was in
some cases forbidden its use; but then cold bathing
was enjoined. Knighthood was originally a religious
institution, and the conferring of it is a church
ceremony. The aspirant knight <em>prepared himself by

entitled “The Order of the Bath.” Now, the Sovereign
who confers, and the knights who receive the

lives.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_71"></a><a href="#footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>When tesselated pavements of Caldaria, or fragments
of Laconicum and Hypocaust come to light in
our streets or fields, the modern Goth gazes with the
same stupid wonder, without the same
respect<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_72"></a><a href="#footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></span> with
which the barbarians of this land look upon their
fathers’ works;—you can tell them the date of their
ruins; they could explain to you the use of yours.
The Romans could recall the time when their fathers
only washed their hands and their
feet;<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_73"></a><a href="#footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></span> the Turks,
the time when their fathers washed neither. We have
to recall the times when our fathers knew what it
was thoroughly to be washed, and to be wholly clean;
and, reversing the experience of these people, and
combining in our progress their points of departure,
we have arrived at washing hands and feet only, or
washing neither.</p>

<p>Britain received the bath from the Romans, Ireland
from the
Phœnicians,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_74"></a><a href="#footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></span>
Hungary from the Turks,
Spain from the
Saracens<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_75"></a><a href="#footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></span>—everywhere
it has disappeared.
In Greece it was as common as in Turkey.
Greece became independent, and the bath took
wing.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_76"></a><a href="#footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></span>
Everywhere throughout Europe the point of departure
is cleanliness, the result of progress is filth. How is
it that a habit so cleanly, associated with edifices so
magnificent, leading to intercourse of the classes of
society so useful to the state, and conferring on the
poorer orders so large a measure of comforts and
enjoyments, should have disappeared, wherever light,
learning, taste, liberality have spread? When abstractions
have got possession of the brain of a people,
you can no more reckon upon its tastes, than upon
its acts.</p>

<p>“What ruler in modern times can make a comparison
otherwise than degrading to himself between
the government over which he presides and those of
ancient Greece or Rome? Can he reflect, without
taking shame to himself, that the heads of the republics
of Athens and Sparta, the tribunes, ædiles, consuls,
censors, and emperors of Rome, thought they
had not rendered the condition of the poor tolerable,
unless they had afforded them the gratuitous enjoyment
of baths, theatres, and games, to make them
forget for some hours of the day the hardships and
privations which poverty brings with it? The boasted
happiness of the English common people (if, indeed,
any one can be hardy enough to vaunt it now-a-days)
is infinitely lower than was that of the plebeians of
Greece or
Rome.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_77"></a><a href="#footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>The evils of our system do not spring from the
violence of passion, but from fallacies. We, of course,
cannot grapple with our own fallacies; therefore all
that philanthropy and science can do, is to try to
heal, one by one, the sores which legislation engenders
wholesale. The bath is an idea which the
simplest mind may grasp; it is a work which industry,
not genius, is required to accomplish. We found
hospitals for the sick, we open houses of refuge for the
destitute; we have recently been engaged in finding
nightly shelter for the homeless; wash-houses have
even been established. How many are anxious to
find some sort of holiday, or innocent recreation, for
the classes, whose commons we have enclosed, and
whose festivities we have put down;—how many
seek to raise the lower orders in the moral and social
scale? A war is waged against drunkenness, immorality,
and filthiness in every shape. Here is the
effectual weapon!—here is an easy and a certain cure!
It is no speculation or theory; if it were so, it would
easily find apostles and believers.</p>

<p>The good-will and means that run to waste through
our not knowing how to be clean, are enormous. A
small town in the New Forest, with Roman daring,
planned a bath as a work of public utility, but built
it with English coin, of which it took 8000<abbr title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr> There
are steam-apparatus, reservoirs for
sea-water,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_78"></a><a href="#footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></span> &amp;c. It
was a model bathing establishment. It is now selling
as bricks and old iron! Close by there are large
boilers for evaporating salt, over which, at the cost
of a few planks, a Russian vapour-bath might have
been had. The use of the vapour was not unknown.
There were persons who repaired thither for cutaneous
and other disorders, and were cured.</p>

<p>Consider the heat and steam throughout the manufactories
of England, which the instinct of a Russian
boor, or Laplander, or Red Indian would apply for the
benefit of the miserable population engaged in those
works, and now allowed to run to sheer waste. The
filthiest population exists, with the most extensive
means of cleanliness. A nation that boasts of its
steam, that is puffed up with its steam, that goes by
steam, does not know how to use steam to wash its
body, even when it may be had gratis.</p>

<p>The people that has not devised the bath, cannot
deserve the character of refinement, and (having the
opportunity) that does not adopt it, that of sense.
Servility, however, we do possess, and any person of
distinction has it in his power to introduce it. That
which all despise, when only a thing of use, will be
by all rushed after when it becomes a matter of
fashion. The sight of a bath of a new fashion, and
enjoyed by another people, has impelled me to make
this endeavour to regain it for my own. Is Europe
ever to remain on the map the black spot of filth?
Can she owe the bath only to the Roman sword or
Moorish spear? Must she now await the Cossack
lance? After ridicule for warning, the day may come
that I shall suffer reproach for deprecating the event,
and it will be said to me, “<em>These</em> barbarians, who,
Providence-like, have come to compose our troubles;
Roman-like, to teach us to be clean.”</p>

 Returning on one occasion to Europe by Belgrade, I
brought some Turks by the steamer up to Vienna to show them
a little of Europe. After a night on board, my <i lang="fr">levée</i> proved an
awkward business. In a Turkish household all the servants
attend their master while he dresses. That is the time to prefer
petitions and make complaints. Every one is there, and
may say what he likes. On the morning in question, they were
mute as statues; knowing the cause, I dared not look at them.
They had seen the Europeans <em>wash</em>. Silence being at length
broken, they began to narrate what they had seen. Among other
jottings for a book of travels they would have mentioned, that
a <em>priest</em> had taken water in his mouth, and then slobbered it
over his face. I told them that these were not my countrymen,
and asked them if they had not seen the two English officers
wash (I had observed from the single cabin on deck, which
the captain had given up to me, canteen dishes, soap, towels,
&amp;c., going down for them); after a pause one of my Turks
said, “<cite>Zavale belmester</cite>. The unfortunates! they don’t know
how!”</p>

 One of the luxuries of the Roman baths consisted in their
brightness, the command of the prospect around, and in various
strange contrivances. By one of these, the bather, while swimming
in warm water, could see the sea; by another, the figures of the
bathers within, were seen magnified without. “They were not
content unless they were coloured as well as washed,” says Seneca
(<abbr title="Epistles"><cite>Epist.</cite></abbr> 87).</p>

have attendants, few or many; the street-porter is so awakened
by his wife, or child, or brother, and he in turn renders the
same service. The soles of the feet are exposed to a severity of
service which no other muscles have to perform, and they require
indulgent treatment; but with us they receive none.</p>

 I was desirous to bring to Europe a young Turk, and he
was nothing loath: his mother, however, made objections, which
I could not get from him. At last, he said, “You must talk
to her yourself.” I went consequently; and when I introduced
the subject, raising up her two arms before her face as they do
when depressed or abject, with the hands turned down and
wringing them, she exclaimed: “Vai! Vai! are not your ships
made fast under my windows, and do I not see how the Franks
wash?”</p>

 A plan has recently been successfully adopted for drying
horses after hunting. Two men, one on each side, throw over
him buckets of water as hot as he can bear it: he is then scraped
and rubbed with chamois leather, the head and ears carefully
dried with a rubber, and his clothing put on. In twenty minutes
he is perfectly dry, and there is no fear of his breaking out
again: the old plan of rubbing him dry took from one to two
hours of very hard work, and he generally broke out once or
twice, and would often be found in a profuse sweat at twelve
or one o’clock at night. The bath might be adopted for horses.
The Muscovites used to mount from the dinner table on horseback;
at present we shampoo our horses, and clear off the epidermis,
while we bestow no such care on our own bodies.</p>

 “The chiefs of either sex are, with very few exceptions,
remarkably tall and corpulent. For this striking peculiarity
various reasons may be suggested.... But in addition to
any or all of these possibilities one thing is certain, that the
easy and luxurious life of a chief has had very considerable
influence in the matter: he or she, as the case may be, fares
sumptuously every day, or rather every hour, and takes little or
no exercise, while the constant habit of being shampooed after
every regular meal, and oftener, if desirable or expedient, promotes
circulation and digestion, without superinducing either
exhaustion or fatigue.</p>

Mexicans, by stones heated in a furnace, and on which water is
thrown. They have seats at different heights, and by ascending
increase the temperature (the <dfn>concamerata sudatio</dfn>, as painted in
the baths of Titus). They have a cold douche, which descends
from the top of the chamber, and is repeated twice during the
bathing. They do not shampoo, but with a bunch of birch,

on the back and then on the face.</p>

 The trough full of hot water called a bath, used to cost in
London at least one shilling and sixpence, so that persons
with less than 200<abbr title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr> a year could not afford to use them. In Paris,
with fuel and water so much dearer, baths can be had as low

it radiates on thee, with cunning symbolic

towards all good things whatsoever. The oldest eastern

that it was the Maker’s gift and will. It remains a religious
duty in the East. Nor could Herr Professor Strauss, when I

<p class="footnote">“With respect to the sweating-houses, as they are called, I
remember about forty years ago, seeing one in the island
of Rathlin, and shall try to give you a description of it:—It
was built of basalt stones, very much in the shape of a
bee-hive, with a row of stones inside, for the person to sit on
when undergoing the operation. There was a hole at the top
and one near the ground where the person crept in, and seated
him or herself; the stones having been heated in the same way
as an oven for baking bread is; the hole on the top being
covered with a sod, while being heated; but, I suppose, removed
to admit the person to breathe. Before entering, the
patient was stripped quite naked, and on coming out, dressed
again in the open air. The process was reckoned a sovereign
cure for rheumatism and all sorts of pains and aches. They
are fearful-looking things, as well as I remember.”</p>

<h4 class="h4head"><span class="allsmcap">THE HELOT.</span></h4>

<p class="p2">Three days which I spent at Dar el Baida were
occupied in a hot contest with my soldiers, and every
person in the town seemed to have got involved on
the one side or the other. They insisted on my
returning straight by the sea-road to Rabat. The
ingenuity and perseverance they displayed was of the
highest order, considering that every step they took
was a failure. Their object was to get back as soon
as they could; but, as they dared neither leave nor
constrain me, I successfully opposed the <i lang="la">vis inertiæ</i> to
all their devices. At last they gave in, declaring they
were ready to accompany me when, where, and how
I liked; but, just as we were setting forth, and were
all assembled on horseback near the only gate, I
discovered a fresh plot to frustrate a boar-hunt, which
I had fixed for the following day.</p>

<p>I slipped off my horse, and gliding round a corner,
and otherways deceiving their vigilance or observation,
I got away without being observed by any one, for
the whole of the inhabitants were collected to see
the start. There was but this one gate; but in
my archæological researches I had discovered a part
of the wall which was scalable: I made for it, got
over, and dropped on the other side. After sitting
on their horses’ backs for better than an hour, and
fatiguing their poor necks, they got alarmed, instituted
a search, ransacked the town, and were at their
wits’ end, when a gardener entered the gate with his
ass, bearing a load of mussels, which, he informed
them “the Nazarene” had gathered on the rocks off
the “point.” They now started in pursuit, accompanied
by every person in the place who could muster
a horse or mule. I was seated on the top of the
promontory as they galloped up. I was prepared for a
frantic scene, but the first glimpse, as their faces came
in sight over the cheek of the hill, satisfied me that
they had passed into a new phase. I had entered
on the hereditary privileges of a saint or madman.
I was adjured and entreated, and suffered myself to be
lifted on the horse brought for me, and from that
hour experienced nothing but affability, and the
readiest assent to whatever I proposed. At the boar-hunt
next day they mustered on foot, stripped off their
sulams and haïks, ready to join in the sport, and one
of them sent a bullet through a boar’s heart.</p>

<p>After a few days spent in hunting, we were at our
last bivouac before entering Rabat; and again amongst
the Ziaïda, we entered a douar without parley,
trusting to Sheik Tibi’s authority, but were bluntly
told that they had “no room.” After some talk,
our men marched out of the circle, and commenced
unloading the camels fifty yards off. I was delighted
at the thought of a quiet night away from
the cattle, dogs, and “Lancasterian method;” but
this was only a ruse. Presently a chief came out, and
seized in his arms the pole, with the pendant roof
ready to be stretched. Our people, after a simulated
attempt to pitch, yielded, and tent and baggage were
carried into the centre. Some of the tribe inquiring
who and what we were, a grotesque attendant, with
a face like a mask, and a mouth like a cavern, replied
instantly, “This,” pointing to me, “furnishes
the Sultan with guns, gunpowder, and balls, for he is
a great friend of his. This,” pointing to Mr. Sernya,
“is the representative of the seven kings of Christendom,
and I am Abd Rachman of Sus.” I asked
how it could come into his head, to say that I furnished
guns and gunpowder to the Sultan? He answered,
“I wished to make them know that it was
good for us that you were here, and I spoke what
they could comprehend.”</p>

<p>Here was a living hieroglyphic, exactly the manner
in which the old Egyptians took, to figure things
in lines and drawings. What they looked to, was
the phantasm produced upon the mind. Hanno, in
his Periplus, the moment he turned Cape Spartel,
comes upon flocks of pasturing elephants, and these
elephants were unknown to the Egyptians, as they
were unknown amongst the Greeks, until Alexander
sent one home. Consider then the enormous prices
paid for ivory; how completely the Phœnicians kept
the ancients in ignorance of the sources of the supply
even in their neighbourhood. But I refer to this,
not on account of the ancient quadruped population
of Mauritania, or the commerce of the Mediterranean,
or the traffic of the Phœnicians, but as illustrating
the hieroglyphic method of introducing me
by my Breber attendant. The first notice that we
have of the elephant, is amongst the Ethiopian tribute
to Tothmas the Third; that is to say, I find there
the elephant, though there are no signs of it in the
figures. There are two bulls with curious little
heads of Blackamoors between the horns, which at the
extremity are divided as if they were
antlers.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_79"></a><a href="#footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></span> Now
in this I read “Elephant.” The tusk in all ancient
languages was called <dfn>horn</dfn>, the trunk <dfn>hand</dfn>. The
painter had to represent a “bull with horns and
hands.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_80"></a><a href="#footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></span>
But as bulls had already horns, there was
nothing remarkable therein. How to give a bull
a hand was a matter of some difficulty. By placing
the little human head upon the centre of the forehead,
the symbolical character of horn and hand was
achieved.</p>

<p>During the discussion respecting our admission to the
douar, the word “Helot,” was shouted out by a sharp
lad, who insisted on taking me under his protection.
This was the gist of the matter—we were Helots, and
I wondered if it was some Spartan mode of expressing
contempt. It was the very Spartan word, and the
Helots of Laconica and the Kabyles of Algeria are derived
from the distinction—of which I was now made
aware—between the Ziaïde <dfn>el Gaba</dfn> and the Ziaïde
<dfn>Helots</dfn>, and which I suppose would be more accurately
rendered Ziaïde <dfn>el Gabal</dfn> and Ziaïde <dfn>el Loto</dfn>.</p>

<p>Marmol speaks of them as a tribe; he says, “The
whole country between Fez and Morocco is peopled
with Beribas and Helots, who are a mixture of
Africans and Arabs, besides other powerful Arab
tribes who possess the country, and pasture their
flocks between Fez and the sea. The two most
powerful races of Mauritania and Tangitana, are the
Ibue Maliks Sophean, and the Helots. They furnish
11,000 horse to the Sultan.”</p>

<p>In our boar-hunting expeditions, we constantly
stopped to gather blackberries from a tree between
the olive and the myrtle, which, afterwards, when I
had the opportunity of consulting authorities, I found
to be the very
<em>Lotus</em>.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_81"></a><a href="#footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>Add to Loto the Arabic article, and you have
at once Heloto, Helot. Unless I had been particular
in my inquiries, I should have imagined that
Heloto was the name of a people. A descriptive
term derived from the tree may have therefore been
applied in Greece, and mistaken by travellers in
Sparta, or commentators at Athens, just as this has
been mistaken by Marmol and Bochart.</p>

<p>The turpentine-tree had also the same name, <dfn>eloth</dfn>,
and it is curious that the same learned critic has
derived the names of the two Jewish roots, from
exactly the same distinction as that which prevails
between the two branches of the Ziaïde. Eloth from
the tree, Ezion Gaber from the rocky nature of the
country.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_82"></a><a href="#footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></span>
He traces the etymology by a different
process, which I will not follow. I content myself
with the coincidence of results.</p>

<p>There was a plant of the name as well as a tree.
The Egyptian Lotus was a stock that came up by
the water with a head like a poppy, containing
grains like millet. They were allowed to ferment,
and then dried and pounded. It was the lightest
and pleasantest of bread when eaten warm; but, like
Indian corn, became heavy and indigestible when cold.
Those who lived on it suffered from no diseases of the
stomach. It was therefore considered a cure for all these.</p>

<p>The tree was the object of religious veneration,
and was brought to Italy at a very early
age.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_83"></a><a href="#footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></span> It was
planted in the temenas of temples. The deities so
distinguished were those peculiarly Asiatic. One at
the temple of <span class="place">Diana Lucina</span>, was four hundred and
fifty years old in the time of Augustus: it was called
Capellata, because the <i>Vestal Virgins</i> brought them
and concentrated their hair. Another, equally remarkable
for its enormous roots, stood by the temple of
Vulcan. The word lotophagoi was derived from the
tree, not the plant, for Pliny applies to the tree what
Homer has said of the lotus and its fruit. The plant
has played a part in nomenclature, such as no other
can aspire to, not even the laurel, cedar, myrtle,
platanus, or oak—giving its name to a people in
Homeric time, and continuing to do so after thirty
centuries. It may not therefore be so extravagant
to look for traces of the name, to the north
of the Mediterranean, whither not only the Phœnician
rites, but the tree itself had been transplanted.</p>

<p>The origin of the Helots is a mystery: the Doric
conquerors of Laconia subjugated the original inhabitants,
and these are distinguished into two classes,
the Perioikoi, and the Helots; the Perioikoi, or
“Dwellers around,” was a general term applying to
the Messenians, and Laconians. The Helots being
distinguished from them, must have been of a different
race.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_84"></a><a href="#footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>The fables, which strangers coming to Sparta report
of their manners, and their introduction into public
festivals, preserves to us distinct features and characters
which, as Müller suggests, identify them with
those people of Asia Minor who worshipped the
Great Mother.</p>

<p>Such a connexion might in some degree account
for that very extraordinary event, the colonization of
Cyrena by Spartans, which is the reverse of the current
of ancient colonies. It furnishes also a key to
the idea of the people of Judæa, of their relationship
with the Spartans. When the Jews sent ambassadors
to Rome, they directed them to go and salute their
brethren at Sparta.</p>

<p>Commentators and etymologists have endeavoured
to explain the fact away, but the shout of the child
in this sheepfold, while pointing, “There
Helots;”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_85"></a><a href="#footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></span>
and “Here El Gaba!” seems to me to throw light
upon portions of Greek history, which Thucydides has
not elucidated, and which Potter and Fuller have
not explained, and on passages of the Maccabees
and Josephus, which Michaelis has amended and
explained into nonsense and confusion.</p>

<p>As to the name Helot, we are left equally in the
dark. That it was not their own name for themselves
is shown by the etymology suggested, and no one would
accept it, but because he can find no other. The derivation
from the town <span class="place">Helos</span> is ungrammatical, and
would only shift the difficulty of admitting its derivation
from the participle of the verb “to capture;”
the word, however, occurs in another shape. There
was a festival called Heloteia—the Helotean—the festival
of the Loto. It was held in Crete (a Phœnician
settlement). It was to commemorate the rape of the
Phœnician Europa. Here is a new puzzle. Again
is introduced the easy expedient of the participle;
then it is supposed that the Phœnicians called a
virgin Helotes. Bochart exposes the absurdity of
these suggestions, and remarks that Europa was no
longer a virgin when she came to Crete. He derives
it from <dfn>Halloth</dfn>, Hebrew for <dfn>epithalamium</dfn>, forgetting
his own objection of the minute before, and moreover
that her marriage could not well be celebrated
after her death; besides, there was another festival
called Heloteia at Corinth, where there was no question
of “virgin,” or of “capture,” or of “marriage.”
It was held to commemorate the staying of a plague.
Having then swept away all these suppositions, let us
see what the Heloteia was. It was a festival in
honour of Europa. The <dfn>boves</dfn> were carried in procession,
and surrounded by an <em>enormous wreath</em> or
garland, thirty feet in circumference. This garland
had a name: it was <dfn>Hellotis</dfn>, <ins title="Hellôtis" lang="el">Ἑλλωτίς</ins>.</p>

<p>It was not uncommon to designate festivals after
the garlands which surrounded the objects of veneration.
That for the return of the Heraclidæ was
called <dfn>Stemmataïa</dfn>, from the garlands round the figure
of the rafts upon which they came into Peloponnesus.
It is said, indeed, that the Hellotis was a garland of
myrrh. The Loto is very like myrrh. The Greeks
adopted the myrrh itself from the Easterns. It was
appropriated to funeral ceremonies. It is mentioned
by Nehemiah as one of the four trees used in the
festival of the tabernacles, and classed with the palm,
the olive, and the fir. In the traditions of Arabia,
Adam fell from Paradise with three things—“A branch
of myrrh, a date, and an ear of corn.”</p>

<p>The word is found, little altered, scattered all over
Greece. There is the district of Elatea in Epirus,
Elatea city of Phocis, Helos in Laconia, Helos again
in Macedonia, Laitæ on the Sperchius, and Hellopia
is so often repeated, that it must have been a generic
term. It applies to one third of the island of Eubœa.
It is also a town there. It is found again to the
south-east of the Pindus, and it is the name given
to the district of Dordona. But it does not stand
alone. The multitude of Phœnician and Hebrew
names could never have been found there, unless it
had been inhabited some time by tribes speaking the
one or the other language; as for instance, the Laleges,
the Bryges, and the Helots. The twin term to Loto
has played a not less important part. It has penetrated
into all the languages of Europe, and is spread
over a large portion of what to the ancients was the
known world. It is still to be traced in the name
of the mountains, which were the limit between the
Phœnician and Celtic races. We have it in Gabii
of the Etruscans; we have it in the centre of Africa;
we have in the Holy Land, <dfn>Gaba</dfn>, <dfn>Geba</dfn>, <dfn>Gabala</dfn>,

<h4 class="h4head"><span class="allsmcap">THE ARABS OF THE DESERT.</span></h4>

<p class="p2">The Moors divide their country into four zones,
running north and south. First, the <dfn>Zahel</dfn>, or sandy,
unwatered, and level ground; secondly, the <dfn>Tiersh</dfn>,
or deep black land, without trees or mountains, and
composing the centre and chief portion of Morocco;
thirdly, the <dfn>Gibellu</dfn>, or cultivated portion on the side
of the Atlas; fourthly, the
<dfn>Tell</dfn><span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_96"></a><a href="#footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></span>
(the earth), on the
other side. Beside these, there is the subdivision into
<dfn>Heloto</dfn> and <dfn>Gaba</dfn>.</p>

<p>Mr. Parke heard the name Zahel in the interior,
and thought it meant “north country.” Mr. Jackson
corrects him. “Zahel,” he says, “signifies an <em>extensive
plain</em>. Thus, the plains south of the river of
Suz, and the low country on the coast near Walhadia,
are called Zahel; and if an Arab were to pass over
Salisbury Plain he would call it Zahel.” Mr. Jackson
is as much mistaken as Mr. Parke. The word
means <dfn>a thing that is easy</dfn>. The wealth of the Zahel
tribes consists in cattle and flocks: their sole culture
is grain. They produce corn, wool, butter, hides and
skins; they buy nothing except arms and fruit; they
treat their money as they do their corn. This year
a fine imposed in consequence of the recent troubles
was paid without difficulty, though equal to several
years of their customary taxes.</p>

<p>The Zahel is one half the year exposed to scorching
heat; it is destitute of trees and water, and could
scarcely be cultivated by people having fixed habitations.
The Arabs shifting their domicile to find
pasturage for their cattle sow as they proceed, and
return in like manner to reap. They sow from November
to March. The harvest soon follows. The summer
is, so to say, their winter, for the sun is their Boreas.
The seasons are reversed. The flowers that were
budding only on the plains, I found in full blossom
on the hills: under the genial influence of cold, vegetation
had re-commenced. Their culture consists in
scraping the light soil in opposite directions with a
primitive plough; a pointed piece of wood unshod
with iron and a single handle, which the ploughman
carries a-field upon his shoulder. They do not even
clear the ground of the palm shrub, but plough round
it. Sometimes, indeed, you see the land in very good
order, for there are no weeds.</p>

<p>The first idea suggested is that of depopulation.
On closer inspection, one is astonished at the numbers
of the people. They subsist on little. They draw
comparatively a great deal from the soil, and the
rudeness of their implement is not unadapted to its
lightness. The tribe does not cultivate in common,
but the families do: the daughters have half portions:
they average a plough per tent, some having four or
five, or more, others not even a pair of cattle, but
managing one with another, so that each shall cultivate
a plough land. Oxen are generally employed,
but horses are so also: you may see pairs of horses
driven by the reins. Some of their teams are grotesque
enough. I have seen a camel and an ass
ploughing together. Whatever animosity there may
be amongst the tribes, whatever insecurity for their
cattle, even in the midst of their encampment, common
necessities have consecrated the standing corn,
and every tribe respects its neighbour’s landmark.</p>

<p>They have as little trace of limits, as the dogs of
Constantinople, which maintain their bounds so well;
or of laws, as a community of bees. I have had,
however, a terminus pointed out to me between the
Ziaïda and their neighbours. It was a plant of the
Silla kind. They have the custom of “beating the
bounds,” and understand it in a literal sense. The
children are taken out and thrashed at appropriate
places, that they may recollect them well. On the
other hand, they run no risk of flogging for a false
quantity in a dead language. Behind these zones,
Zahel, Tiersh, Gibellu and Tell, lies the Zahara.
Along the Medelmah the zones run east and west,
following the direction of the coast; but here the
first three are wanting; there is only the Tel, and
behind it the Zahara. The regularity, however, of the
distribution is disturbed by the great mountain block
of the Cabylie, which lies in the rear of Algiers, and
which is nearly insulated by the Desert.</p>

<p>Adjoining the Moorish Tell, and deeply encroaching
on the Desert, is the Beled-el-Gerid, or oasis of
Tafilelt, the inner Moorish kingdom; and, so to
speak, its fountain. This is the land of dates and
of Morocco leather. Here is the inaccessible retreat
to which in all dangers the Moorish princes retire,
and from which they issue to recover their lost power.
Here are deposited the treasures accumulated during
seventy years by two thrifty monarchs, and which are
estimated at tens of millions sterling. It is a little
world within Morocco, entrenched behind the Desert
and the Atlas. It takes ten days across the Desert
to reach it from the nearest point of the regency of
Algiers.</p>

<p>To the south of the neck of the Atlas which runs
out to the cape of St. Cruz, lies the fourth kingdom
composing the empire; the parallel zones are here
arrested by the Atlas. The country partakes of the
nature of the Beled-el-Gerid, and is a great oasis,
exceeding, indeed, all the others in richness and variety
of produce.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_97"></a><a href="#footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></span>
It is entirely inhabited by Shelluk,
or southern Brebers, over whom the authority of the
Sultan is held by a very precarious tenure: it was
there, however, that the dominion of the shereffs was
first set up, and from it they issued to conquer Morocco
and Fez. Suz and Tafilelt are said to possess resources
not inferior, though hardly different, to those
of the other two.</p>

<p>The population has been rated as high as sixteen
millions. It is half Arab, half Breber. The climate
is admirable, being tempered by the westerly breezes
and the snows of Atlas. The middle region is composed
of alluvial plains of inexhaustible fertility: the
two capitals lie in tertiary basins resembling those
of Paris and London. The fruits and produce comprise
all those of the tropics and the temperate zones:
harbours alone are wanting, but this deficiency is more
than compensated to this people, by the security which
the difficulties of the coast afford.</p>

<p>The first thought on setting foot upon the land
of Africa is, of course, the Desert. When starting
on my first journey, I indulged in the fancy that I
was approaching it;—what was my surprise on asking
one of my companions to describe it, to be told,
“Look round, this is the Desert.” Our notion of a
moving sea of sand is a delusion; there is no considerable
district where, as in the insulated points
in the Indian and Pacific oceans, man has not found
an abode. Africa is not a vacant and a useless space.
Extending from the valley of the Nile to the Atlantic,
and from the narrow slip along the Mediterranean
down to the kingdoms of Guinea and Bourno, &amp;c.,
it has its mountains and plains, its valleys and forests,
and even its streams and rivers. One of the men
who were with me described the road from Fez by
Suz to Tafilelt, round by the south, a journey of about
a thousand miles, as through a rich, well-watered—or
if not well-watered, well-wooded—country, with the
olive, oak, arar or date. On the road from Tafilelt
towards Timbuctoo there is the great oasis of Tuat,
which is distant about two weeks’ journey. There
are either trees or brushwood the whole way. “The
map of the Sahara,” says M. Revon, “will be one day
covered with rivers, hills, and an immense number
of names of wells, stations, and countries. The Desert
being entirely inhabited, or traversed by nomade
people, they require to designate by particular names
the places that furnish subsistence for their flocks
during half of the year, the countries that they
are obliged to avoid and to pass round, the wells
so indispensable to their existence, and the beds of
the rivers, which at certain seasons of the year furnish
them with water.”</p>

<p>This unique country, taken together with that
character of the people, which they must have in
order to be able to inhabit it, has preserved a class of
the human race in its primitive state. There are
nowhere resources, so that there should be large
accumulations of people to pass through the various
phases which in other portions of the world humanity
has presented. There is not the sea to divide or to
conjoin; they cannot muster in strength (save as
dependent upon the northern country) so as to be
formidable abroad, and they are so movable within,
that they are not liable to domestic oppression. Pasturage
and rapine are the two avocations. Culture is
not unassociated with the first, and rapine, as managed
here, is not incompatible with traffic and good
faith.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_98"></a><a href="#footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>There are four methods of travelling; the regular
trade caravans, small companies on fleet dromedaries,
single messengers on foot, and the peregrinations of the
tribes themselves. Of the first, or the <dfn>cafileh</dfn>. These
are periodically fixed, and connect the three regencies
in the north with the Negro countries of the south,
taking in the two great bases, the Fezzan and Tuat,
with Timbuctoo. Their speed is about twenty to
twenty-five miles a-day, and, laden as they are, they
have often to avoid the shortest roads, and to make
great circuits in order to obtain supplies of water.</p>

<p>It is quite a mistake to suppose that the traveller
in the Interior is reduced to dependence upon these
caravans. On the dromedary fifty miles can easily
be performed. A tract of three hundred miles without
water, at least where there is insecurity as to
finding it, imposes on a cafileh the necessity of carrying
ten days’ supply to a party which can traverse it.
During four days it presents little inconvenience:
being all mounted, they can easily carry water and
provision for themselves for the distance which the
dromedaries can travel without water.</p>

<p>Their provisions consist in barley, roasted and
bruised, and, if they are luxurious, honey and butter.
The meal is mixed up with any of these, that is to say,
with either honey and butter or water, the first being
used as the morning meal and the latter for the
evening; and this food not only enables them to do
their work, but also to support thirst.</p>

<p>The cafileh must be strong enough to fight its way.
Solitary travellers, or small companies, can only pass
by one of two methods, having with them a saint, or
the relative of a saint, or having a friend or a hired
guide, <dfn>mehri</dfn>, belonging to the tribes through which
they have to pass. These they exchange from tribe
to tribe.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_99"></a><a href="#footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>Messengers and couriers on foot carry with them
their skin of meal, and, when requisite, their skin of
water; and with a similar protection, will traverse
these vast regions at the rate of forty miles a-day.</p>

<p>Lastly, comes the most interesting of all these
movements—a tribe in march, which is then called
<dfn>nafla</dfn>. Some of these, on the northern side within
the regency of Algiers, where more is known of their
movements, yearly perform a journey of six hundred
miles backwards and forwards, from the date-growing
region to the Tell, carrying down dates, and bringing
back grain, and pasturing their flocks as they come
and go. The season so corresponding, they have to
come down to the lowlands for their pasturage at
the time of the harvest of grain, and to return to the
south at the time of the harvest of dates. Nothing
can exceed the interest of these ambulatory cities,
which carry everything with them; where are commingled
signs of domesticity<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_100"></a><a href="#footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></span>
and circumstance of
war. They are merchants and soldiers, shepherds
and manufacturers, cultivators and wanderers; they
carry with them their children and their law—their
judge in peace, their chief in war; they may be called
at any moment to traffic or to fight; they are on the
alert for a verdant plain, sending forth scouts to
discover a fountain or a hostile camp. If suspicious
signs appear, then every man falls into rank, knows
his place, and it is a regiment that advances or
encamps. There is the council of the elders, to determine
whether it is war or peace; and a treaty may
be signed or a battle engaged. By these necessities
certain proportions are given to these bodies. They
must never be too weak to defend themselves, nor too
strong, to devour the pasturage, or drink up the water.</p>

<p>We know only the discipline of men, but the
discipline of the Zahara extends to the family. The
utensils, the home itself, everything is compact, and
all as ready as the people are alert. Our armies are
liable to lose themselves at once, either with the
people they subdue or with the people through whose
territories they pass. An invading Arab carries with
him, and plants his home, as we do a standard; and
where it comes it is not a victor’s banner that is
reared, but a hostile roof that is upset. The idea of
resisting the shock of such a horde, could it be let
loose on a European community, is not so much
as to be entertained. But M. Thiers thinks the
Arabs very bad
soldiers.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_101"></a><a href="#footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus is the surface of Africa converted into a plain,
covered with lines along which move, and circles
round which revolve, these planetary bodies. Man lives
where it appeared a wilderness, and order rules where
it seemed a chaos. There is no land that is not
owned; there is no pasturage that is not assigned.
The fields may appear deserted, and the space vacant;
but, with the times and seasons, they return, traversing
the same vales, drinking at the same fountains,
cultivating the same valleys, and as indestructible
in their race as they are regular in their motions.
Like the ocean which guards them, they will fill, as
they have filled, their space; and, like the seasons
they resemble, they undergo the changes of the year;
and summer and autumn will find them again and
again at their appointed task and place.</p>

<p>With the beauty of order is associated the drama
of life, as if the planets were moved in their sphere
with love or hatred, and propelled and attracted, or
connected with each other. The chords of sympathy
are so stretched, that the dissensions of the most
insignificant members of this vast community in the
centre of the Desert may be felt and responded to on
the borders of the Mediterranean or
Atlantic.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_102"></a><a href="#footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>The people of the town are a distinct nation. On
the face of the land alone is to be seen the stretched
canvas of the fleeting sons of the Desert. From the
tent reared and displaced in an hour, what an age
is passed, as you cross the city
gateway!<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_103"></a><a href="#footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></span> In the
Arab dwelling there is no sense of age; there is no
mark of newness, nor sign of mouldering decay.</p>

<p>The soil on which they tread, and from which
they feed:—carved by no fosse, confined by no bound,
and bearing no load, is a nature—subdued indeed, but
untravestied—and presents the wildness of the Desert
without penury, its freedom without solitude: the
gifts it gives are favours rather of Providence, than
fruits of toil.</p>

<p>Pass the yawning barbican and ruined walls—enter
the city, the work of Cyclops or Titan—of Philistine,
Hebrew, Lybian, Roman, Goth, Vandal, Saracen, Portuguese,
or Spaniard—and there is man! nothing but
man! It is not, as in other cities, the men and
things of to-day, but of old times and ages. Thinly
scattered, these are each a nook in the stream of
time, when the wrecks of successive storms are cast up—a
Bantry Bay in the Atlantic of eternity.</p>

<p>Zahara means resplendent. Zeara, in Hebrew, is
round. The first was an ancient epithet of Venus;
the second, a name for the
moon.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_104"></a><a href="#footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></span> Thus, the region
of death and terror, of the Zamiel and the locust,
appears to them a place of light and splendour. It
has the charm of battle for the brave—of ocean for
the rover—of rocks for the mountaineer. But what
need comparison? it is the Desert to the Arab.</p>

<p>It is not the ambition of visiting the mud huts
of Timbuctoo which has led so many European adventurers
to peril their lives, and to lose them in that
vain attempt; but it is the indescribable charm of the
Desert life of which they have felt the influence, or
caught the contagion. Without the protection of
constituted governments, despite all obstructions,
danger, distance, thirst and hunger, commerce is carried
on nowhere in the world with more regularity,
integrity, and security. There are no internal fluctuations,
no international barriers; <em>exchange presents
no difficulty</em>, although they have a standard of value.
This is an ideal money, or a coin of account. In
the south it is the “bar,” in the north it is “Pezetta;”
in other districts, “Naia,” &amp;c. A piece of iron, a
Spanish coin, a measure of dates—any other object
would serve equally well to constitute this unit, which
represents value with absolute perfection, precisely
because it is a measure—as an inch or a pound.</p>

<p>They do not say a bar is so many pounds, so many
ounces, and so many grains; and this quantity of
metal shall be the standard of value; that is, the value
of all things shall be changed to meet the accidental
fluctuations in this quantity of metal; for, according
to their barbarous notions, that would be not an
ingenious device to facilitate business, but a piece
of knavery too barefaced to be dangerous. If iron
becomes cheap, two bars of iron go to “<em>the</em> bar;” if it
becomes dear, half a bar of iron goes to “the bar.”
The ideal standard is preserved because it is ideal.
Yet, here are barbarians! This subject is at once
the most practical and scientific,—money, arithmetic,
commerce, property! Well may Solomon exclaim,
“God made man, but he has found out many inventions.”</p>

<p>Ebn Khaldoun has a passage which seems at once
to throw light on the origin of the term and the antiquity
of the practice. “In the times of ignorance the
Arabs counted by various dirhems; the <dfn>tabori</dfn> was
the weightiest, the <dfn>bagli</dfn> the lightest.” The Mussulmans
fixed a middle term, and adjusted to it fines,
&amp;c. A discussion then arose on the ancient value of
these coins, and as to whether they were, or were not,
known in the time of Mahomet. Ebn Khaldoun
decides as follows: “The valuation of the dirhem
was known, but there was no corresponding coin;
nevertheless, judgments were regulated according to
the valuation of that money.”</p>

<p>If any one is curious to know the meaning of the
words “currency law,” he will find it all in this
sentence of the late Lord Ashburton: it is a process
by which, “in the event of a deficient harvest (or any
other internal disturbance), <em>a few shrewd capitalists
can so control the supply of gold as to enrich themselves
and ruin the nation</em>.” This is all that it
requires to know on this subject, to be perfectly
happy and content; for, as to doing anything, that
is out of the question. The “press,” and “public
opinion” may upset ministers, and substitute theory
for theory; but, against any deep purpose or design,
they can avail nothing, even supposing that they
were not the blind instruments of the designing,
and stormed and ranted against them from Land’s
End to John o’ Groat’s. A pasquinade, stuck at night
to a pedestal under the papal government of Rome,
had more effect on the affairs of that government
than all the free press of England thundering together
could have on its government—at least, when the
really important points are concerned, viz. the profits
of the capitalists or the service of the Czar.</p>

<h4 class="h4head"><span class="allsmcap">RETURN TO RABAT FROM SHAVOYA.</span></h4>

<p class="p2">During my absence two daring crimes have been
committed: a Shereff stole one of the Sultan’s horses
from the midst of the camp. The Sultan sentenced
him to lose his head. He then put in the plea of
his birth. “Then,” said the Sultan, “cut off his right
hand, that he may be disabled from disgracing his
blood in this way in future.” There is no executioner:
the butchers are bound to perform this
duty.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_105"></a><a href="#footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></span>
The chief Jewish and chief Mussulman butcher being
called, they offered for a substitute by a sort of public
auction, the crier commencing in this way:—“Who
will cut off a head” (or a hand) “for a dollar?—one
dollar offered,” and thus they ran up and down
the street. No one offering, they increased the bid
to two, three dollars, &amp;c. When they had arrived
at two doubloons (7<abbr title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr> 10<abbr title="shillings"><i>s.</i></abbr>),
a tall black stepped
forward and said, “That is my price.” A tub of tar
was brought: the black hacked off the hand in a
hurry, and on dipping the stump into the tar it
proved to be cold. He had, however, bound the arm
before the amputation, and they ran to the neighbouring
blacksmith’s shop for embers, which they
threw into the tar, and, setting it on fire, the stump
was then plunged in, and so scorched and burnt.
The Shereff was then let go.</p>

<p>In the other case, the culprit, a man from the interior,
had killed a lad who was ploughing, and carried
off his cattle. The Sultan said to the mother of the
lad, “Excuse his life, and take one hundred dollars:”
she said, “I want the life of him who took the life
of my son.” The Sultan three times repeated his
question, doubling his offer: she said, “I ask what
the law gives me, and that law you are Sultan to
execute.” The culprit was led out to execution:
the head, as we returned, was on the market-gate,
and the dogs swarmed round the carcass.</p>

<p>The news of a change of ministry in England was
conveyed to me in a letter from Gibraltar, without
any explanation: I sent to notify the fact to the
government. Mustafa Ducaly came to learn the
particulars, none of which I knew; and I explained
to him what I supposed to be the cause and circumstances,
viz., the corn laws; and I added that I expected
the next news would be that Sir Robert Peel
was again in office with more tractable colleagues.
This greatly damped the excitement which the news
had created, for they expected, on the return of the
former foreign minister to office, a war with France.
They were, however, interested in this event on other
grounds, namely, the admission of corn into England.
I did not repeat to them a long-formed conclusion,
that Sir Robert Peel would be the man to open the
ports, as the reduction of the price of corn, without
a relaxation of the currency laws, was merely an
augmentation of the value of money.</p>

<p>The Sultan is to remain here the winter, which I
look upon as ominous for the town, as, besides the
inconvenience of his abode, there are no resources in
the place for this assemblage; and it is not in the
memory of man that the Court of Morocco has held
the festivities of the Baïram, or spent the winter out
of one of the capitals, except in time of war. The
explanation given is, the disturbed and disaffected
state both of Morocco and Fez; but this is no explanation,
for the presence and not the absence of an
Emperor of Morocco is the remedy against disaffection.
Fez is entirely commanded by the fortifications, and
in Morocco the Sultan is himself fortified. If there
were danger from either capital, the troops would
be sent there, not kept
here.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_106"></a><a href="#footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>The rumour of the discovery of mines had reached
Rabat with speed and exaggeration. Full of childish
impatience, the Emperor sent immediately for the
specimens I had brought. Twenty camel-loads of the
ore were ordered down, and messengers were despatched
to Rif to bring some of the best workmen
in iron. I asked for such workmen as they had to
erect a furnace, and we commenced operations in a
little court behind the consulate; but the furnace
they made was only good enough for copper, with the
smelting of which they are familiar: we had, therefore,
to turn masons and bricklayers ourselves. We
got what they assured us were bricks of fire-clay;
and we succeeded so well with the furnace and the
blast that we melted, like water, not the ore—but
the bricks. However, we did fuse a portion of the
ore, and thus saved our credit. After expeditions
in search of fire-clay, and various renewed attempts,
I had to dissuade them from proceeding thus recklessly;
and told them that they might find as rich
mines more conveniently situated, or mines of some
other metal better worth working; or iron, if not
so pure, more malleable (for on this their present
instruments could make no impression), or, in fact,
coal and iron in juxta-position. They answered,
“No! no!—the tribes where these mines are, are
submissive: we don’t want to make the others fat.”
Nothing would do but the new hobby. They
proposed to form a company of all the merchants.
They were bountiful in offers: one half of the proceeds
of the mines in Shavoya, and of that which
they already worked in the Rif should be mine if I
would undertake to send proper persons to conduct
the enterprise.</p>

<p>I thought this a favourable moment to press my
request to be permitted to go to Fez: I was told
that if the Sultan were there, there would be no
difficulty, but at present it was impossible. I have
therefore determined on returning to Gibraltar, and
visiting, if possible, the mountainous district lying
to the eastward of Larache, called Serser, where
sulphur, lead, and salt are already known, and there
are indications of coal.</p>

<p>The smelting is not the only business in which
we have been engaged in the back-yard. I had
brought two camel-loads of boars, the produce of our
last day’s sport, before re-entering Rabat, with the
design of curing the hams. Our first construction
of furnaces was for boiling water for pig-scalding, in
which, in consequence of the time that had elapsed,
we failed. The saying about a “pig coming to be
shaved” occurred to me, and I got a Jewish barber
to do that work—and a strange sight it was! It
was hot work, between the smelting and the boar-shaving,
and we got more assistance in the one enterprise
than the other. Inexperienced in jointing and
paring hams, I think we made very sightly work
of it. I was more at home at a <i lang="fr">ragoût de Sanglier</i>,
of which an enormous cauldron figured among
the operations of that court-yard, to the high applause
of all the Nazarene population that chanced to be at
Rabat. It was not, however, very easy to get at it
when cooked; for to all the plates, knives, and forks,
saucers, and tea-cups, &amp;c., it was taboo.</p>

<p>While these operations were proceeding in the
court-yard, the other parts of the consulate were
equally put in requisition for the purposes of science.
We had constructed a hydraulic blow-pipe, and the
Moors were delighted to behold spinning glass and
little men, ships, &amp;c., and no doubt many of these records
of our visit will be treasured up for future
times. The kitchen was the scene of other labours—the
preparation of the wonderful <dfn>majoun</dfn>, made
from the plant well known as <dfn>hashish</dfn>, which is here
grown as any other crop, and of which the consumption
is next to universal.</p>

<p class="p2 center allsmcap">HASHISH.</p>

<p>This plant seems to have been known and used,
as at present in Morocco, in very ancient times, from
the confines of China to the Western Ocean. It appears
as the <dfn>potomantes</dfn> of the Indus, the <dfn>gelatophylis</dfn>
of Bactria, the <dfn>achimenes</dfn> of the Persians, the <dfn>ophisnu</dfn>
of Ethiopia, the <dfn>nepenthes</dfn> of the Greeks. The apparently
contradictory qualities ascribed to these may
all be found in the hashish: like the ophisnu, it recalls
consciousness of the past and inordinate fears, on
account of which it was given as a punishment to
those who had committed sacrilege; but, above all, it
brings too that forgetfulness for which Helen administered
to Telemachus the nepenthes, and which no
doubt she had learned in Egypt. Equally does it
become a poison which absorbs all others. It will
explain the incantations of Circe, and the mysteries
of the cave of Trophonius. When taken without
suspicion, its effects would appear as the workings
within themselves of the divinity. It goes some way
to account for the long endurance of a religious imposture,
so slightly wove and so incessantly rebelled
against. Here was a means at the disposal of the
priest, diviner, and thaumaturgist, and beyond all
appeals to the mere imagination. The epithets which
the Hindoos apply to their <dfn>bangue</dfn> might equally serve
for the <dfn>hashish</dfn>—“assuager of sorrow,” “increaser
of pleasure,” “cementer of friendship,” “laughter-mover.”
Bangue, however, when often repeated, “is
followed by catalepsy, or that insensibility which
enables the body to be moulded into any position,
like a Dutch jointed doll, in which the limbs remain
in the position in which they are placed, and this
state will continue for many
hours.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_107"></a><a href="#footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>It seems from an early period to have been used
in China medicinally. Fifteen hundred years ago,
it was employed there as chloroform recently has
been in Europe; so that it may truly be said, “there
is nothing new under the sun.” The following passage
occurs in “The Compilation of Ancient and
Modern Medicines,” published in China at the beginning
of the sixteenth century:—</p>

<p>“If the complaint is situated in parts upon which
the needle, the moxa, or liquid medicaments cannot
produce any action—for instance, in the bone, stomach,
or intestines—there may be given to the
patient a preparation of hemp (<dfn>ma-yo</dfn>), and in a very
short time he becomes so insensible that he seems
intoxicated or deprived of life. Then, according as
the case may be, the operations are performed, of
amputations, &amp;c., and the cause of the malady is
removed. Subsequently, the tissues are brought together
by sutures, and liniments are employed. After
some days the patient is restored to health, without
having felt, during the operation, the least
pain.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_108"></a><a href="#footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>Among the ancients of our part of the world, it
appears to have been employed by the mystics only,
and not to have been in common use; whereas, in
China there was no more mystery attending it than in
the exhibition of any other drug; consequently, from
China and from India the Saracens may have got it.
The term <dfn>hashish</dfn><span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_109"></a><a href="#footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></span>
means plant in general, but the
preparation is called <dfn>majoun</dfn>—perhaps from the Chinese
<dfn>ma-yo</dfn>.</p>

<p>It was in Egypt, between the tenth and the fourteenth
centuries, that hashish was in its glory. He
who wishes to know to what excess of passion the use
of this narcotic can inspire, may find his curiosity
gratified in an account, by Makrizi, of the “Herb of
the Fakirs;” and the notes appended to it by
Mr. Silvestre de
Sacy.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_110"></a><a href="#footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>In Mr. Von Hammer’s History of Hassan Saba, hashish
figures as nerving the arm of his followers to
strike at ministers in the midst of their guards, and
at monarchs in the centre of their
capitals.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_111"></a><a href="#footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></span> The
terror with which these fanatics inspired the nations
reached even to this island, and the Commons of England
obtained, as an antidote for the
hashish,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_112"></a><a href="#footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></span> the
serjeant-at-arms and the mace.</p>

<p>To this sect was given the name of Assassins.
According to the highest authorities, it comes from
<dfn>ashasheen</dfn>, or eaters of hashish. But a real existence
is now denied to those enchanted gardens of Alamoot,
and they are explained as merely the visions created
by the intoxicating
plant.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_113"></a><a href="#footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></span> Visionary speculation!
The preparation requisite for such deeds was not
opium or alcohol, far less a plant, the effect of which
exceeds intoxication, and approaches insanity.</p>

<p>The Ismalian departed on his journey of death
<em>alone</em>. He followed his victim for months and years;
he traversed deserts and sojourned in populous kingdoms
and cities. It was an intoxication of the
spirit, not of the senses, that could so dare and so
endure; neither softened by intercourse, nor dismayed
by solitude, and proof alike against the virtues and
the vices of our nature. If such deeds were the
product of this drug, they would appear when it was
used.</p>

<p>Hassan Saba was one of those men, who being
incomprehensible, is the source of fables, devised by
those who do not understand the results they would
account for. He combined leadership of men with the
priesthood of a sect, and inspired his followers with
that boundless awe and affection, which made them
appear under the influence of a supernatural agency.
When he answered the demands of Malik Shah by
ordering two of his followers to cast themselves from a
precipice, he prepared them by no drug. The Ismalians,
acting as men out of their senses, would be
called hashasheen, just as we would say Bedlamite.
If any set of men in Barbary were so conducting
themselves, they would be called hashishlee, though
they had <em>never</em> tasted majoun.</p>

<p>I was led to take an interest in this plant from
the following circumstance. A lady, suffering from
spasms, arising from an affection of the spine, had
obtained some years ago a small portion of hashish (at
the time a name unknown), when all other narcotics
had failed: it afforded her an almost miraculous
relief. Medical men had been applied to in India to
procure the bangue, but it failed. The hemp of England
had been tried in vain. I wrote to Mr. Lane,
then in Egypt, requesting him to obtain some, but
he found it a disgraceful thing to make inquiries on
the subject. All these endeavours ended in disappointment.
Still I remained satisfied that there was
such a plant. At Tangier I observed a diminutive
pipe, about the size of a thimble; I asked what kind
of tobacco they were smoking. I was answered, <dfn>kef</dfn>
(literally, enjoyment),—it was the hashish. I found
that it was also taken inwardly. Either the leaves
are swallowed with water, after being crushed, or it is
prepared, and boiled with sugar or honey, and butter,
like horehound, a great variety of seeds and spices
entering into the composition, which is thus said to
vary in its effects, and to be gifted also with medicinal
powers. This preparation is the majoun. Its effects
were described as those of the laughing gas, except
that, instead of a few minutes, it lasts for many hours.
Some cry, some laugh, some fall into drowsy listlessness;
some are rendered talkative and funny. They
see visions, imagine themselves reduced to poverty,
or become emperors and commanders of armies, the
natural disposition predominating in the derangement.
Men under its influence were pointed out to me in
the streets. They walked along with fixed eye, heedless
of all around them. Some take it daily in small
quantities, producing, as one of them described it
to me, “a comfortable state of mind,” without appearing
to impair the general health. Under its influence
the mouth is parched; it is not in their power to
spit. Their eyes become red and small. They are
ravenous for food. Everything that one hears of it
has the air of fable; and I should have been inclined
to treat it as such, but for the evidence of my own
senses.</p>

<p>Finding that I could not understand from description
either the mode of preparing it, or the effects, I
determined to get those who were accustomed to make
it to bring the materials, and prepare it before me,
and then to try it myself, and on as many others as
I could. I was so engaged for a week after my return
to Rabat, for I had successively the three most
noted confectioners to try their skill against each
other. They have not a regular or uniform process,
and the majoun is consequently of very unequal
strength and efficacy. Our first attempts were failures.
The first proof of the success of our preparation was
in the case of a young English clergyman, to whom
some of it had been given as a sweetmeat. Some
hours passed without any visible effects, when a
musician, who had the faculty of strangely distorting
his features, came in, dressed as a mummer. The
Englishman took him for the devil, and a most laughable
scene ensued. Next morning, on inquiries after
his health, he said he had slept soundly and agreeably,
“as the windows and doors were bolted.” Later
in the day the effect disappeared entirely, and he
seemed to recollect the circumstances with a confused
pleasure, describing various things that had never
happened.</p>

<p>The first time I took it was about seven in the
morning, and in an hour and a half afterwards I perceived
a heaviness of the head, wandering of the
mind, and an apprehension that I was going to faint.
I thence passed into a state of half trance, from which
I awoke suddenly, and much refreshed. The impression
was that of wandering out of myself. I had
two beings, and there were two distinct, yet concurrent
trains of ideas.</p>

<p>Images came floating before me—not the figures of
a dream, but those that seem to play before the eye
when it is closed, and with those figures were strangely
mixed the sounds of a guitar that was being played
in the adjoining room: the sounds seemed to cluster
in and pass away with the figures on the retina.
The music of the wretched performance was heavenly,
and seemed to proceed from a full orchestra, and to
be reverberated through long halls of mountains.
These figures and sounds were again connected with
metaphysical reflections, which also, like the sounds,
clustered themselves into trains of thought, which
seemed to take form before my eyes, and weave themselves
with the colours and sounds. I was following
a train of reasoning; new points would occur, and
concurrently there was a figure before me throwing
out corresponding shoots like a zinc tree; and then,
as the moving figures reappeared, or as the sounds
caught my ear, the other classes of figures came out
distinctly, and danced through each other.</p>

<p>The reasonings were long and elaborate; and though
the impression of having gone through them remains,
every effort has been in vain to recall them. The
following scene was described by me, and taken down
at the time:—</p>

<p>A general, commanding an army, and doubting
whether he should engage the enemy, consulted the
oracle. The oracle answered, “Go with the fortune
of Cæsar.” He gave battle, and was beaten; his
king ordered his head to be cut off, but the general
accused the oracle: the king said, “The oracle is not
in fault; it did not tell you that you were Cæsar;
you were twice a fool to mistake its meaning, and
your own worth.” The general answered, “Then is
the fault his who sent a fool to command his armies.”
“Nay,” answered the king, “thou shalt not twist one
phrase to thy benefit, and another to my loss.” This
scene seemed to pass before me, and in the region of
Carthage, which was all familiar, though I had never
been there. The general was an Abyssinian, the king
a white man with a black beard.</p>

<p>The next time I tried it, the only effect was to
make me lose a night’s rest; the first time, it had
given me a double portion of sleep: on both occasions
it enormously increased my appetite. It was followed
by no depression. The third time I took it,
at half-past four, and after it, a liqueur glass of caraway
spirits to hasten the effect. An hour afterwards,
walking on the terrace, I began to experience the
effects. I did not feel cold, while those who were
walking with me, and wrapt in mantles were complaining
of it. They profess to be able to prepare
it, so that it shall serve a man instead of
clothing. Then came an unsteadiness of gait—not
that of one who fears to fall—but of one who tries to
keep down, for I felt as if there were springs in my
knees, and was reminded of the story of the man with
the mechanical leg, that walked away with him. I
sat down to dinner at half past six o’clock. There
was a glass between me and the rest of the company,
and an inch or two interposed between me and whatever
I touched. What I ate, or how much, did not
matter;—the food flowed like a river through me.
There was a wind going by, blowing over the table,
and carrying away the sounds, and I saw the words
tumbling over one another down the falls. There is a
dryness of the mouth, which is not thirst. The dryness
radiated from the back of the throat, opposite the
nape of the neck. It was a patch of dark blue colour;
the food, as it reached this point, pouring down, and
taking the colour of the patch. I was under the impression
that I described all this at the time, but
was told that I would not say anything about myself,
or describe what I experienced.</p>

<p>I should have been relieved if some one present had
been under the same influence. The bursts of laughter
to which I gave rise were not at all pleasing, except
when they were excited by any observation I made
which was not connected with myself. I never lost the
consciousness of what was going on; there were always
present the real objects, as well as the imaginative
ones; but at times I began to doubt which was which,
and then I floated in strange uncertainty. It came
by fits at—as I thought—hours of interval, when
only minutes could have elapsed. Sometimes a week
seemed to pass between the beginning and the end of
a word. I fancied my head an inverted pendulum,
which it cost me a great deal of labour to keep
straight, when I could resist no longer, and let it go,
and it went back as if a blow had been discharged.
I struggled against each relapse, out of a sense of
politeness towards the company, of which I did not
fail to inform them, notwithstanding their roars of
laughter. The back of my neck was the pivot; there
was a heavy upper weight on the top of my head, and
the pendulum was swinging between my legs; but the
pendulum was attracted upwards to the table, and I
had to struggle to keep it down by keeping my head
up. The swinging fit was accompanied by bursts of
laughter. I derived great pleasure from allowing my
head to go back; but the laughter was unlike any
mortal merriment; it seemed as never to end, and to
press me, and to lead up to a mountain-top. When
any one put his hand behind my head, fearing the
effect of the jerks, or that I should throw the chair
over, I was very much annoyed, because it disturbed,
as I said, “the isochronism of the oscillations.”</p>

<p>I afterwards saw a similar effect produced on a
European who did not know what he had taken. He
was constantly throwing back his head and looking at
the ceiling, and exhibited no other symptom, which
only made this the more ludicrous.</p>

<p>After keeping the party for four hours in a state of
continual convulsion, I became irresistibly drowsy, and
was moved away to bed. This operation sickened
me, and brought on a slight vomiting. The instant I
was in bed I fell asleep, and slept without intermission
for nine hours; I then awoke, perfectly recovered,
and fresh, with a feeling of lightness, and in high
spirits.</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable effects was, that it
seemed to lay bare your inmost thoughts, and to
present a mirror, on which was reflected every act of
your life, and that you were constrained to reveal and
confess it all; which exactly agrees with effects attributed
to the ophisnu.</p>

<p>The Jews are in the habit of taking hashish on
Saturday, as it ensures, they say, their doing no
work on Sunday. A party of them will agree to take
it together, and go out to a garden. One of them,
being asked to describe a scene of that kind, said,
“We were eight, and seven took to laughing, and one
to crying, and the more he cried the more we laughed,
and the more we laughed the more he cried, and so
we spent the night, and in the morning we went to
bed.”</p>

<p>After being satisfied with my preparation, I devoted
a day to the trying of the experiment on a
number of patients. Two or three took it in the
morning, and each as he had taken it became exceedingly
anxious to administer it to others, so that
patients were sought in every place and by every
means. Many who took it went away, so that I did
not see the effect on more than a dozen. On the
whole I was disappointed: there was not one interesting
case, though there were not two alike.</p>

<p>The master of a Portuguese vessel, to whom it was
given without his being aware of its nature, thought
himself bewitched, and his crew were on the point
of securing him as deranged. He saw a ship stranded
on the bar, and ordered out his boats to her assistance;
he then saw the devil cooking in the caboose,
and with the demeanour of an insane person, was all
the while reasoning on the evidences of his insanity.</p>

<p>Having at one time been in the habit of taking
opium, I am able to compare the effects. The idea
of a strong resemblance has been generally admitted;
but in this I cannot agree. In De Quincy’s “Confessions
of an Opium-Eater,” there are passages which might
pass for a description of hashish, but they do not
appear to me to be descriptive of opium: opium
does not give the double identity, and the hashish
draws towards insanity: the hashish does not affect
either the nervous system or the viscera. The
length of time that elapses before it begins to act,
shows that it has first to be taken into the blood.
I have witnessed its effects in relieving pains and
spasms, which differ from those of ordinary
narcotics.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_114"></a><a href="#footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></span>
It is an anodyne and an anti-spasmodic, producing
intoxication without its consequences, and dispelling
its effects.</p>

<p>The French have become intoxicated with hashish.
A number of works and essays have been
published on the subject in Paris. Multitudes of
experiments have been made, and endless visions seen
or described. From these I select one specimen,
which to him who has eaten hashish bears intrinsic
evidence, <i lang="fr">pour le fond</i>, of being genuine. “It appeared
that his body was dissolved, that he had become
transparent. He clearly saw in his chest the hashish
which he had swallowed, under the form of an
emerald, from which a thousand little sparks issued.
His eyelashes were lengthened out indefinitely, and
rolled like threads of gold around ivory balls, which
turned with an inconceivable rapidity. Around him
were sparklings of precious stones of all colours,
changes eternally produced, like the play of the kaleidoscope.
He every now and then saw his friends
who were around him disfigured—half men, half
plants; some with the wings of the ostrich, which
they were constantly shaking. So strange were these,
that he burst into fits of laughter; and to join in
the apparent ridiculousness of the affair, he began
throwing the cushions in the air, catching and turning
them with the rapidity of an Indian juggler.
One gentleman spoke to him in Italian, which the
hashish transposed into Spanish. After a few minutes
he recovered his habitual calmness, without any bad
effect, without headache, and only astonished at what
had passed. Half-an-hour had scarcely elapsed before
he fell again under the influence of the drug.
On this occasion the vision was more complicated
and more extraordinary. In the air there were millions
of butterflies, confusedly luminous, shaking their
wings like fans. Gigantic flowers with chalices of
crystal, large peonies upon beds of gold and silver,
rose and surrounded him with the crackling sound
that accompanies the explosion in the air of fireworks.
His hearing acquired new power: it was
enormously developed. He heard the noise of colours.
Green, red, blue, yellow sounds reached him in waves.
He swam in an ocean of sound, where floated, like
isles of light, some of the airs of 'Lucia di Lammermuir,’
and the 'Barber of Seville.’ Never did
similar bliss overwhelm him with its waves: he was
lost in a wilderness of sweets; he was not himself;
he was relieved from consciousness—that feeling which
always pervades the mind; and for the first time
he comprehended what might be the state of existence
of elementary beings, of angels, of souls separated
from the body: all his system seemed infected
with the fantastic colouring in which he was plunged.
Sounds, perfume, light, reached him only by minute
rays, in the midst of which he heard magnetic currents
whistling along. According to his calculation,
this state lasted about three hundred years; for the
sensations were so numerous and so hurried, one
upon the other, that a real appreciation of time was
impossible. The paroxysm over, he was aware that
it had only lasted a quarter of an hour.”</p>

<p>The Moors have long been in possession of Dr.
Hunter’s idea,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_115"></a><a href="#footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></span>
that certain qualities are conveyed
by certain kinds of food: his notion is, however,
limited to corporeal effects. Thus, a person with
an affection of the liver should eat the liver of animals—the
heart, &amp;c. The Moors imagine that the
mind can in like manner be affected, and that the
quality of the animal is conveyed to the eater. The
flesh of the fox gives cunning, the heart of the lion
inspires courage. Probably it was to improve her
complexion that the African Cleopatra ate pearls.
To designate a stupid person, they say, “He has eaten
the head of a hyena;” and as the hyena is very
fond of hashish, his fixed eye and stupid look are attributed
to the effect of that plant, for he will sit
in the bottom of his den and allow it to be entered
by a man who shoots, stabs, or nooses him. They
give it also to horses, as it was told me first, to make
them fiery; but on further inquiry, I found that it
was given to them as a purge, and that afterwards
they leave them in repose like men, as they are unable
to keep their feet.</p>

<p>There are several other plants which they employ
for producing similar effects—that which I afterwards
found at Medea, and which is there described
as the <dfn>surnag</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_116"></a><a href="#footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></span>
which is found in the Atlas, and
which is used for the same purpose; also the nuts
of a species of the Palma Christi, which they mix
with food, and the effect of which lasts but a few
hours. This is said to be used to make people speak
the truth, and discover their inward
thoughts.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_117"></a><a href="#footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>Extensive as is the use of this drug, it is not used
by the gentleman. On him observances are heaped
which the vulgar escape, and indulgences denied
which they enjoy. A Moorish gentleman is more
constrained and more observed than the same class
in any other country: he must be punctual in the
discharge of his religious duties, which are neglected
by the mass of the people; he must pay the regular
alms to the poor; he abstains from all kinds of fermented
liquors: he does not smoke or take snuff.</p>

 “The butchers, that they might not be compelled to execute
this sentence, took sanctuary. A stranger, and a ruffian, was
found, who consented to perform the service. The gates were
shut to keep the people in meanwhile. When over, and the
gates were opened, the soldiers refused to protect the executioner.
He was then chased like a mad dog by the children into the
country, and then shot by a relation of the deceased.”—<span class="smcap">Hay’s</span>

 I may here anticipate the event which occurred a fortnight
afterwards. One morning the leaders of the revolt, amounting
to eighteen, were secured, Mike Brettel, of course, among the
number. The whole was considered a master-stroke of policy,
dexterity, and dissimulation: however, it failed in one point.
By such influences as Walter Scott exhibits in the opening of
the Tolbooth of Glasgow to Rob Roy, some of the chiefs <em>who
belonged to clans</em>, escaped the Sultan. He thought it needless,
and perhaps imprudent, to proceed against the mere citizens.</p>

from opium, whose power is marked upon the muscular and

seem to be affected; but it is not with impunity that the brain
becomes disordered with frequent indulgence in the delicious
poison: it becomes incapable at last of separating the true
from the false.”</p>

<h4 class="h4head"><span class="allsmcap">THE HISTORY OF MUFFINS.—THE ORIGIN OF BUTTER.—THE<br>
ENGLISH BREAKFAST.</span></h4>

<p class="p2">The day we landed at Rabat we heard a little
tinkling bell through the street, just like the four
o’clock muffin-bell in London. One of the party
asked if it were tea-time amongst the Moors, and
the others laughed, thinking it a good joke:—there
was no joke in the case. These cockney cakes are
just as common here as within the sound of Bow
bells, and served for breakfast in Barbary when Queen
Elizabeth’s maids of honour had for theirs beefsteaks
and ale, or herrings and bread and cheese. They
are a little larger than those in London, and exactly
the <dfn>peiklets</dfn> of the midland counties.</p>

<p>To find muffins and crumpets here is, indeed, in
the language of modern philosophy, a “great and
a twofold fact.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_118"></a><a href="#footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></span>
It is, however, one which great
men have overlooked; because, although a cook must
be a philosopher, it is not required that a philosopher
should be a cook.</p>

<p>The incident set me upon considering the nature
of the muffin, and opened to me a large field of
speculation, culinary and historical. I first perceived
that there were combined in the greasy accompaniment
of our tea-tables characters so diverse, that it
must have a history, and an eventful one; that it
must have undergone vicissitude and persecution in
the course of its wide career, the range of which in
space and time could not be doubtful, from the place
in which I found it.</p>

<p>Let me dispose first of the word <dfn>crumpet</dfn>: it is
clearly a recent one. Peiklet is still used in the
interior of England, and one name is given to both
by Moors and Jews, <dfn>sfen</dfn>; I shall, therefore, equally
employ for both the word
“muffin.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_119"></a><a href="#footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>The muffin is <dfn>bread</dfn>,
<dfn>cake</dfn>, and <dfn>dish</dfn>:<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_120"></a><a href="#footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></span>
like the first,
it is fermented; like the second, baked or toasted
on a griddle; like the third, it requires to be cooked
before it is eaten. Our method of cooking, by toasting
first and then softening by butter, appears at the first
glance the travestie of some lost method. The use
of the toasting-fork could not have preceded coal-fires
and grates with upright bars, an invention not
earlier than the Georges; nor could it have preceded
the use of butter, which cannot be traced beyond
the Dutch stadtholder. In America, they do not
toast and butter muffins, but eat them hot, as baked.
They were, therefore, originally a part of the regular
cookery of the country, and, indeed, could not belong,
as at present, to “breakfast” and “tea,” which meals
are of recent invention. Morocco presents the original
practice: here they are simmered in oil or
butter, and then dipped in honey. I did not see
them used in dressed dishes; but Marmol, writing
two centuries ago, describes them as employed in
this manner. He says, “In Morocco, there are two
ways of making bread—baking in an oven, as we
do in Europe, and preparing it in pans to be eaten
hot with honey and butter, or with oil. These cakes
are sometimes stewed with the flesh of goats, for
that of sheep is difficult to be got at, and that of
cattle they do not consider
wholesome.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_121"></a><a href="#footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>The Moors and the Jews cook them differently,
the former using butter, the latter oil: they thus
connect baking and cooking, and illustrate differences
between Judaism and Islam, or, perhaps, between Jew
and Gentile. With these data it may be worth
while to endeavour to find traces of them in ancient
times.</p>

<p>Baking in Greece had attained to the highest perfection,
as exhibited in separating or bolling the
flour,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_122"></a><a href="#footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></span>
and in kneading the dough.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_123"></a><a href="#footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></span>
The art of baking,
as connected with religious festivals, possessed an
importance which, to us, is inconceivable. Among
the Greek states, Athens was most distinguished for
its bread; yet there were there foreign bakers—and
these Lydians.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_124"></a><a href="#footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></span>
There was bread known by the
name of Cappadocian, and the Phœnicians were held
bakers of first repute. This people was said to possess
as many kinds of bread as there were days in the
year: their merit, however, does not seem to have
consisted in baking, properly so called, but in combining
preparations of flour with other viands; and
in the Old Testament we have constant references to
the mixtures of flour with oil and honey, all which
approach to the Moorish sfen.</p>

<p>The names of only three out of the three hundred
and sixty-five kinds of Phœnician bread have been
handed down: the three resemble one another. This
must have been the kind of bread for which Phœnicia
was celebrated, and the descriptions apply to
the muffin and the sfen, still preserved in countries
which they colonized. The three kinds are <dfn>lackmar</dfn>,
<dfn>chebrodlapson</dfn>, and <dfn>maphula</dfn>: lackmar is evidently
derived from lackma, to swallow (whence <dfn>lick</dfn>), and
must have been remarkably soft. Athenæus calls it
<ins title="arton hapalon" lang="el">“ἄρτον ἁπαλόν.”</ins> It was prepared with milk and
oil: the Syrians were celebrated for making it. That
it was known to the Jews is proved by the word
<dfn>lachmanigoth</dfn>, which occurs in the
Talmud.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_125"></a><a href="#footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></span> It was
known to the Arabs, and is described by Mininski
as a fritter of flour, dried grapes, oil, and fresh wine:
of chebrodlapson, we only know that it was prepared
with honey. How these were baked is not stated;
but the third, maphula, was not fired in the oven,
but on the hearth, or on a griddle. In the three collectively,
we have all the ingredients and the methods
at present in use in
Morocco,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_126"></a><a href="#footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></span> viz. flour, milk, oil,
honey, and a griddle for firing them.</p>

<p>In maphula, we have the word employed in England.
Taking away the final vowel added by the Greeks, and
changing <i>l</i> for its cognate <i>n</i>, maphula or mufula becomes
mufu<i>n</i>.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_127"></a><a href="#footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>These names have puzzled the most learned. Bochart
avows his perplexity; Casaubon avers that “we
ought not to be ashamed of confessing our ignorance
of what we do not know, and, <i lang="la">ipso facto</i>, confesses
his own.” Their difficulties disappear, as usual, before
the knowledge of habits. Flour, milk, oil, and
honey mixed up together would, indeed, form a sorry
dish; as the critics, not being cooks, could not devise
the process by which they could be converted into
a palatable one. Bochart, with his usual sagacity,
has detected the union of cooking and baking, and
also that the Jews and Arabs cooked the muffin
differently. He has, however, mistaken the distinction;
he makes the Jews use oil <em>or</em> butter, the Arabs
fat: the Jews cook it in oil only, the Arabs prefer
butter.</p>

<p>The griddle on which muffins are baked in
London,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_128"></a><a href="#footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></span>
is precisely the same as that used in the East,
and fixed in the same manner over the fire. It
serves for a variety of other dishes and preparations
of flour.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_129"></a><a href="#footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></span>
On it is made the pastry of the East,
which all travellers have tasted, which many have
pronounced exquisite, and yet which none have described,
or suspected, perhaps, to be different from that
of Europe.</p>

<p>The secret of French pastry consists in bringing
the butter and the dough to exactly the same consistency:
this is effected by temperature for the
butter, by water for the dough, cooling down the
one or softening the other. When so adjusted, the
butter in one mass is covered
in;<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_130"></a><a href="#footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></span>
it then spreads
under the rolling-pin equally as the dough spreads,
each in its own plane. Folded over and over again,
the two keep distinct, and thus are obtained the
flakes.</p>

<p>The butter of the East is fluid, and runs like oil;
how, then, can they have flake-pastry? It was this
difficulty which spurred their invention, and produced
the unrivalled method which I shall now describe.</p>

<p>Wheat is steeped till it sprouts; it is then rubbed
down, or pounded in a mortar, till it acquires the
consistency of cream. In this state it is poured in
ladles on the griddle, rubbed with butter. Instantly
hardening, it is tossed off, sheet after sheet: the name
is <dfn>youfka</dfn>.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_131"></a><a href="#footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></span>
It is then strung, and hung up: when
wanted, a bundle of it is laid into the dish,
or <dfn>taien</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_132"></a><a href="#footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></span>
for the under-crust; the contents, sweet or savoury,
of the pastry, are then put in, and the upper-crust
in the same manner laid on. By this process are
attained, in the highest degree, all the objects of
French pastry—fineness of flour with a certain <i lang="it">agro
dolce</i> flavour, softness in the substance, fineness and
equality in the flake. It has the advantage, also,
over our pastry, of facility and economy of time.</p>

<p>Old Arabic writers mention two kinds of food
prepared by making <dfn>Khebes</dfn>, which are compared to
the banana and <dfn>Neïdeh</dfn> described by Abd Allatib,
as follows: “Wheat is soaked until it sprouts; it is
then boiled until its whole substance passes into the
water; the water is then clarified, and boiled down
until it gets thick; at this point a little flour is
thrown in, and it sets; it is then taken from the
fire, and sold at the price of bread.” This is <dfn>Neïdeh
Albousch</dfn>; but when no flour is added, and it is boiled
until it coagulates, it is better and sells for a higher
price, and is called
<dfn>Neïdeh Makoudeh</dfn>.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_133"></a><a href="#footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>Soyonti speaks of it as one of the things in high
estimation in Egypt, and quotes an old writer, who
says that it was discovered by the Virgin Mary. Being
without milk, she was inspired with the idea of
preparing it for the Infant Jesus. P. Sicard saw
this dish at Meuschieh, and thus describes it: “The
grain is steeped for several days till it sprouts; it is
then dried, pounded or ground, and boiled for use.
A sweet and agreeable confection is then made without
sugar, and the people of the country esteem it
much, and are very fond of
it.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_134"></a><a href="#footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></span> In the time of
Sonnini it had disappeared from Meuschieh. Here
we have the steeping of the grain, the grinding, and
the diluting of it in water, as in the present Eastern
pastry. Although we have not the toasting of it on
the griddle, more cannot be wanted to carry this process
back to ancient times, and to those celebrated
baker-cooks of Tyre and Sidon.</p>

<p>The neïdeh is still preserved in Britain under the
name of <dfn>Frumenty</dfn> or <dfn>Furmity</dfn>. The method of preparing
it is now in the hands of a few persons only,
and has become a secret; and, probably, in another
generation it too will have died out, under the crushing
roller of subdivision of labour. Where still used, it
is only on one occasion in the year, <em>Mid Lent Sunday</em>.
When brought to market it is of the consistence of
thick gum. Those who have eaten it describe it as
an excellent dish. The festival when it is used may
have some connexion with the Arab tradition concerning
Mary’s milk.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_135"></a><a href="#footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>In the Highlands there is at once the neïdeh, the
cadaëf, and the youfka; not, however, by malting,
but by fermentation. Oat seeds are steeped for ten
days till they ferment, the water is then boiled till
it thickens. This is <dfn>sowans</dfn>;<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_136"></a><a href="#footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></span>
or it is poured on the
griddle and made into <dfn>scons</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_137"></a><a href="#footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></span>
which are used on festal
occasions, but chiefly at Christmas.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_138"></a><a href="#footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></span>
That the Highlanders
understood malting is shown in their whiskey,
which they did not wait for Paracelsus to teach them
to distil.</p>

<p>The first step in preparing flour or meal for food,
is the ashes on the griddle; the next and last is, the
oven. The peculiarity of bread resides in the baking
in the oven; fermentation is called in as an auxiliary:
the process is elaborate and complicated. When
first invented, the oven and its produce, the baking
and the bread, would be known by the same name.
In early times words had to do severe duty. A soft
flat roll, resembling the common bread of Barbary,
is called in Scotland, <dfn>bake</dfn>. If so called because it
is baked, it must have been so at the origin of baking.
“Bake” would thus belong to the earliest ages, and
go back to the first discovery of an oven, which, by
one peculiar and horrid ceremony, we can trace to
Sabæa.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_139"></a><a href="#footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, this very word is written in a book two thousand
three hundred years ago, and then as an old one—as
one of the oldest in use among
men.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_140"></a><a href="#footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></span> There we
learn that the Phrygian name for bread was <dfn>bake</dfn>;
bake was, therefore, asked for three thousand years
ago, by Pelethite or Cerethian at Escalon or Gorja, just
as to-day by the barefooted callant of Paisley or Linlithgow.
It may be objected that the word, if in use
in Canaan, would not have been mentioned as Phrygian;
but the colony may have retained an ancient
word which the metropolis had lost,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_141"></a><a href="#footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></span>
or the metropolis
may, without losing the one, have introduced
new names for new inventions. The Phœnician words
which have been preserved are of that description.
Lackmar, Chebrodlapson, are fine terms, such as
would strike strangers more than the homely one in
common use. The Egyptians, besides, were not given
to travel; and with shoals of travellers and clouds of
books, see how difficult—nay, impossible, it is to get
at the simple things of any country.</p>

<p>However, “bake” and “muffin” do not stand alone:
they are accompanied by a goodly array of emigrants
from the Holy Land. I adduce them, not to prove
any affinity of Hebrew and Celtic, or of Indo-Germanic
and Semitic, but to establish the intercourse
of our forefathers with those countries. Thus have
come to us <dfn>cake</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_142"></a><a href="#footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></span>
<dfn>bun</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_143"></a><a href="#footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></span>
<dfn>scon</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_144"></a><a href="#footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></span>
<dfn>sowans</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_145"></a><a href="#footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></span>
<dfn>bread</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_146"></a><a href="#footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></span>
<dfn>broth</dfn>, <dfn>bear</dfn><span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_147"></a><a href="#footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></span>
(old Teutonic for grain), <dfn>beer</dfn>, <dfn>barley</dfn>,
and I may, perhaps, add <dfn>ham</dfn><span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_148"></a><a href="#footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></span>
and <dfn>meat</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_149"></a><a href="#footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></span> which,
with those given before, make a baker’s dozen.</p>

<p>I will now leave it to the antiquarian to determine
whether sfen came hither with the “diggers”
for tin, or with those later “Afers,” whose persons
and wares increased in the eyes of William the Norman,
as the author of “Harold” narrates, the attraction
of the capital of England. But anyhow,
this remains certain, that muffins and crumpets were
served at Hiram’s table.</p>

<p>A stranger from Europe is little surprised to find
<em>butter</em> in Morocco. I had spent years in the East,
and never had seen butter. I had myself introduced
it both in Greece and Turkey; what, then, was
my surprise to find it here. You may see in a
boy’s hand a roll sliced—yes, sliced bread in a Mussulman’s
hand, with a lump of butter inside for his
breakfast, just as in England. It is pale, sweet, cowslip-flavoured,
and smelling of the
country<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_150"></a><a href="#footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></span>—I mean
the country of England. To us butter comes so
naturally—it is so necessary—that we cannot imagine
ourselves without it, nor call up the difficulties
in the way of its first discovery, which is one of
the latest of uncivilized articles among the barbarous.</p>

<p>We read of butter in ancient times, but it was
<dfn>gee</dfn>. The merit of ours is its being made from
cream thrown up cold. The milk of kine alone
has that property; and that milk during many centuries
was unknown to man as food.</p>

<p>The great event of primeval society was the employment
of cattle in tillage. To preserve and increase
the breed was the first care of legislators:
this they effected by consecrating the
cow,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_151"></a><a href="#footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></span> and its
milk was surrendered to its own offspring. The
practice outlived the occasion; and it was not till
horses came to be substituted for oxen in the flat
lands of the north that cows’ milk returned into
general use,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_152"></a><a href="#footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></span>
as it had originally been among nomade
tribes. Cream was unknown to all antiquity.
There is not even the word in any ancient language.
This statement will appear extraordinary, and may,
perhaps, be set down as contrary to reason and unfounded
in fact, for reference to cream in so many
authors will immediately recur. The fact is, that
none of those who have illustrated ancient manners
and language have noticed this point, and they and
travellers have not been conversant with the dairy;
consequently they have transferred their own ideas
to the languages they translated, the usages they described,
or even the very things before their
eyes.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_153"></a><a href="#footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>Up to the time of this discovery the diet consisted,
as in the East, of a repetition of the same meal twice
in the day. The breakfast differed not from the
dinner, except that it was a smaller meal—the dishes
were the same. Butter revolutionized the kitchen.
About the same time two remarkable adjuncts to our
diet were introduced from China and Arabia, tea and
coffee. In their native countries they were no part
of the people’s food, and furnished forth no meal;
they were only used as a slight refreshment. In our
adaptation of them they lost their
flavour,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_154"></a><a href="#footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></span> and no
longer served their original purpose. Our coarse preparation
required to be mellowed by cream or milk,
and sugar. With the aid of butter, they assumed the
consistency of a refection, and with eggs, in the
shell,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_155"></a><a href="#footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></span>
of a meal. This did not, however, suffice as a substitute
for both meals. Beef ruled the evening repast:
the road diverged; two distinct meals came into
existence, and the “English breakfast” assumed its
dignified station in the domestic world. It has spread
far and near, but only where preceded by the discovery
of cream, and accompanied by the manufacture
of butter. Morocco having butter, has the two
descriptions of meals.</p>

<p>They make their butter without churn or cream.
A goat’s-skin, with the hairy side in, is filled two
thirds with milk; four poles or reeds, six feet long,
are set up like a triangle. The skin is slung between
them, a leg stretched out to each reed. A woman,
seated on the ground, pushes and swings it, and
presently the butter is churned. This is the simple
imitation of what accident first taught; and in the
desert the butter is, to this day, churned by the camel,
not by the
dairy-maid.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_156"></a><a href="#footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>The variety of its forms is wonderful. It <em>sours</em>, it
<em>ferments</em>, it becomes <em>sugar</em>—it may be distilled into
<em>alcohol</em>. It changes to <em>curd</em>; it becomes <em>cheese</em>; it
hardens to <em>stone</em>,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_157"></a><a href="#footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></span>
or acquires the tenacity of <em>cement</em>;<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_158"></a><a href="#footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></span>
it leavens into <em>yourt</em>; it dries into
<em>paste</em>;<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_159"></a><a href="#footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></span> it is
separated by heat into <em>caimah</em>; by greater heat into
<em>gee</em>; by repose it gives you <em>cream</em>, by agitation
<em>butter</em>.</p>

<p>The peculiarity of the compound resides in the
mode of mixture of the oil and water. These are not
chemically united, for the oil is obtained without a
reagent. Globules, as in the blood, have been detected.
These by agitation cohere, probably by atomic
polarity. Heat causes oil to appear, by bursting them.
This is the difference between gee and butter. The
globules being congested in a granular state, in butter
and cheese, these when melted cannot be restored,
like wax or lard, to their original condition. The
cases of these globules are the part contributed by the
animal; and, generated in the udder, must be the
caseine, which is acted upon by the rennet, and
becomes curd. However, as these compounds are
not to be imitated by art, so have they not been as
yet explained by science.</p>

<p>From this diet of milk has sprung the invention of
butter. In the Zahara the animals are milked once
a-day. All the kinds of milk are poured in together,
and the distribution is made round and round to a
family in the same cup or bowl. This is the whole
meal.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_160"></a><a href="#footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></span>
What remains over is left for the old men,
and poured into a skin, and put on the camel’s back,
that it may be given to them at the next encampment.
On their arrival it is churned, and thus butter
becomes their perquisite, and is forbidden fruit to the
younger portion of the community.</p>

<p>There is no mention of butter in Homer.
Herodotus<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_161"></a><a href="#footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></span>
and Hippocrates mention it as a Scythian
word. But it is not satisfactory to me that butter is
meant. The most particular description is by
Hippocrates.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_162"></a><a href="#footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></span>
He introduces it as an analogy, to show the
effect of disturbance on the humours of the body.
He makes in that case the bile, as the lightest, rise
to the top; the blood remains in the middle, and the
phlegm falls below, just as the Scythians, by agitating
mare’s milk, get three substances-the <ins title="boutêron" lang="el">βούτηρον</ins>, on
the top, the <ins title="orrhos" lang="el">ὀῤῥὸς</ins>, in the middle, and the <ins title="hippaka" lang="el">ἵππακα</ins>, at the
bottom. Milk is never so treated, and produces no
such substances. We accept the description, because
of the manner of treating it, which resembles churnin
and the word butter. That butter should have been
used among the primitive Scythians, while yet pastoral,
would concur with what we see elsewhere, but
it is not proved by the passages in question. The
word butter may have been known to the Greeks, as
used by some barbarians, and therefore used for all
oily preparations from milk, on this occasion. The
agitation, or churning, is the chief link; but this
again becomes very slight, when we know that the
Tartars to this day employ that process in preparing
milk for distillation,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_163"></a><a href="#footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></span>
and get from it their kermis.</p>

<p>In the domestic economy of the Zahara, milk assumes
an importance which to us is scarcely credible. Periodically
throughout that vast region—and among some
of its tribes
constantly—<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_164"></a><a href="#footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></span> it constitutes the sole and
entire food of the population. “Impossible!” the
animal chemist will exclaim. “Man requires a pound
of nutriment; milk contains seven per cent., or say
one ounce to the pound. He would have to drink
sixteen pounds of milk, that is, two gallons, for the
supply of mere waste of muscle. But milk does not
supply the chemical ingredients for the animal laboratory.
We want carbon for the great furnace of the
lungs to supply heat and life.” I can only allege the
fact. I have myself lived for months almost entirely
on milk, curds, and cheese, and have not found the
animal heat decay. On this diet the frame is able to
support labour and privation, and to last long.</p>

<p>If we are to credit a fraction of the tales that are
told of the age to which the Galactofagi attain, we
should have to set it down as the perfection of
food.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_165"></a><a href="#footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></span>
Nor are the effects of this diet confined to our species:
milk is provender for cattle. It is given to horses
where grain cannot be procured, and, together with
dates, is the ordinary food of those fabulous steeds, the
“Breath of the Desert.”</p>

<p>Milk contains nothing that is superfluous, to impose
toil on the digestive organs, or to produce disturbance
in the animal laboratory. It is, properly, neither an
animal nor a vegetable substance. It is not dead flesh,
of which we make our stomachs the sepulchre; nor is it
the cold vegetation of the earth, for the decomposition
of which we make them a trough. It is generated in
the body of one animal, in order to be adapted for the
food of another. It is drawn from the blood, and
undergoes a change, which brings it near to chyle, so
as to fit it to pass readily again into
blood.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_166"></a><a href="#footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></span> It is a
food prepared, and a dish cooked, by Nature’s own
hand, and served, if not hot, warm. It is adapted to
the stomach before it can bear anything else, being
the first transition from the blood circulated into the
animal without the intervention of its own organs,
and conveying into the body all that is requisite for
its growth and
development.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_167"></a><a href="#footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></span>
Like death, it equalises
all ranks, all races, nay, even brings to the same level
different orders of creation. It is the only food which
the prince and the beggar, the tiger and the lamb,
the Jew and Gentile, have in common; and, in common
with other special favours, of which we are
the objects, we least appreciate where we are most
indebted.</p>

<p>Men may accustom themselves to a fetid atmosphere,
and even to poisonous food, and they are then
unable to appreciate what they lose, or what they
suffer; but the simplest pabulum must best serve the
purposes of life, and in proportion as any other is
substituted, must there be a dissipation of vital power,
and a consequent curtailment of
existence;<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_168"></a><a href="#footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></span> and thus
it is that, amongst the Koords and Zaharans life is
sustained by an amount of nutriment which, according
to our calculations of expenditure and waste, is wholly
insufficient. No nation understands so little the use
of milk as the English. To one familiar with the
cookery and diet of other countries, nothing can be
more afflicting than to visit the abodes, and inspect
the food of those classes amongst ourselves who cannot
afford meat. The fashion of tea, and the mania for
baker’s bread, have expelled popular knowledge in the
culinary art, together with the use of this natural
diet, which is also proportionally diminished by the
enclosure of commons, the methods of agriculture,
and the disuse of ewes’ milk, even when the number of
flocks increase.</p>

<p>Pliny derives the Latin word from the Greek <ins title="boos" lang="el">βόος</ins>
<ins title="tyra" lang="el">τύρα</ins>, without explaining how butter could ever come
to be called cows’ cheese, or observing that mares,
not cows, furnished it. What he tells us of butter
refers to “the barbarians, who,” he says, “use it
instead of oil, to anoint their children, and hold it
to be the daintiest of meats. It is forbidden to
the inferior classes; they employ it as a medicine,
and esteem it the more, the stronger (more rancid)
it is.” The two latter points exactly coincide with
the practice in Africa. For higher classes, read old
men. They use butter medicinally, and for that
purpose keep it till it becomes rancid. The commentators,
however, would amend Pliny by substituting
<i lang="la">minus</i> for <i lang="la">majus</i>! The Roman naturalist in
all he says refers to oiled butter or gee, and not to
butter produced by agitation or churning. He is
astonished that the barbarians possessing butter are
ignorant of cheese; but is by no means surprised at
his own countrymen, who, liking milk and cheese,
could neither make butter nor adopt it. The words
<em>cheese</em> and <em>butter</em>, supposed to be derived from the
Latin, were, as will presently appear, derived by the
Romans from the barbarians.</p>

<p>Butter is mentioned in the Old Testament. The
commentators, however, are agreed that it is a mistranslation.
I admit that it does militate against its
antiquity that it should be so seldom mentioned there.
The imagery of the Scriptures is drawn from the
most homely objects. The worthies of Israel were as
good cooks as Crœsus or Patroclus; the high-priests
were butchers by profession; and all the prophets did
not live on locusts and wild honey;—probably there
was not one who had not used the basting ladle.
If, therefore, they had possessed that delicate and
valuable substance, with which we have become too
familiar for its just appreciation, is it possible that it
should occur but eight times from the beginning of
the Old Testament to the end of the New?</p>

<p>The explanation is furnished in the aversion of the
Jew to butter, to which I have already adverted.
The same distinction between the Jew and the Philistine,
no doubt, held in the time of David.</p>

<p>The Jews interpret the injunction “Thou shalt not
seethe the kid in the mother’s milk,” to mean, that
butter be not mixed with
meat;<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_169"></a><a href="#footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></span> consequently they
do not allow it to touch any pan, dish, platter, knife,
spoon, or dresser used for their ordinary food. “Antagonism”
being thus established between butter and
their common diet, butter does not make “progression,”
nor even hold its own. It is to be inferred,
that the butter they knew contained,—in part at
least,—the milk of goats, as would be the case in the
Zahara method of churning.</p>

<p>It is first mentioned when Abraham entertains the
angels. He took “butter and milk, and the calf he
had dressed.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_170"></a><a href="#footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></span>
Four centuries later, we have “Rivers
of honey and butter;”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_171"></a><a href="#footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></span>
and butter compared with
oil for “washing one’s steps.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_172"></a><a href="#footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></span>
It then occurs in
Moses’s song: “<em>Butter</em> of <em>kine</em>, <em>milk</em> of <em>sheep</em>, and <em>fat</em>
of lambs.” It next appears in Deborah’s and Barak’s
song: “He asked for water, and she gave him milk;
she brought forth butter in a lordly
dish.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_173"></a><a href="#footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></span> It is
brought for David when he is fleeing from
Absalom.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_174"></a><a href="#footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></span>
The wise man speaks of it as a wise man ought: “The
<em>churning</em> of milk bringeth forth
butter.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_175"></a><a href="#footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></span> The last
mention is the most remarkable; it is Isaiah’s prophecy
respecting Christ: “Butter and honey shall he
eat, that he may know to refuse evil and choose good.”
The word translated butter is
<em>imae</em>,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_176"></a><a href="#footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></span> which Calmet
explains as “the scalded cream in use in the East.”
Gesenius says, “Butter by the ancients, as well as by
the orientals, was only used medically.” By others it
is interpreted “curdled milk,” “cheese,” &amp;c. In a
word, the commentators have been as much put out
by Jewish butter as the scholiast by Phœnician bread.
Had curds or sour milk been meant, the proper name
would have been given. Had Calmet known anything
of the scalded cream “in use in the East,” he
never could have supposed that it would be employed
to wash with. None of these could be obtained by
<em>churning</em>. Then it is answered, that the Jews had no
churn. There is no such word in Hebrew: the
passage of Solomon is, “As the <em>churning</em> of milk
bringeth forth butter, so doth the <em>wringing</em> of the
nose bring forth blood, and the <em>stirring up</em> of wrath
bring forth strife.” The same word is employed
throughout—<em>mitz</em>. But the word which could be
translated “churning,” “wringing,” and “stirring up,”
seems most happily adapted to describe the jerk and
swing of the skin full of liquid on the camel’s back,
or the process by which it was imitated.</p>

<p>In none of these passages, save the last, is butter
spoken of as in use among Jews after the promulgation
of the Ceremonial Law. Abraham and Job are anterior,
so is the period to which Moses refers when he
speaks of the good things which they had abused, and
thereby incurred God’s displeasure. When brought
forth in a “lordly dish,” it was by a Midianite offered
to a Hazorite.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_177"></a><a href="#footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></span>
There was much conveyed to the
Israelite in the epithet given to a dish in which butter
could never be placed by him. When brought to
David it is offered indeed to a Hebrew under the
Ceremonial Law, but it might be for the Pelethites
or Cerethian, who accompanied him; it is presented
too by “one of the children of Ammon.” Solomon
might be describing the practice of the neighbouring
Arabs or Canaanites. In both the cases in which it
is mentioned by Isaiah (ch. vii.), viz., that Christ shall
eat it, and that the people shall be reduced to eat
it, no reference is made to a present practice, and
in both cases the sense of breaking the law may be
conveyed.</p>

<p>The Old Testament thus entirely establishes the
present usage of Morocco, and its identity with Palestine.
There, as here, butter was made, and then, as
now, the Philistine fried his muffins in butter, the Jew
in oil.</p>

<p>One of the forms in which milk is most generally
used, and of all, perhaps, the most healthful and
agreeable, is unknown in Europe, and has no name
amongst us: it is a curd (yumed) without rennet. It
is used fresh, but may be drained of its whey and kept
a considerable time. In travelling, it is hung in a bag,
and, when very dry, rubbed down with fresh milk
or water. This is the
<dfn>leben</dfn><span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_178"></a><a href="#footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></span>
of the Arabs and the
<dfn>yourt</dfn><span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_179"></a><a href="#footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></span>
of the Turks: it is also made in India, and
called <dfn>tyre</dfn>. It is made as follows:—the milk is
heated to the point of boiling, and then allowed to
cool down until the finger can be kept in it while
you count three: a spoonful of the old yourt, mixed
first with a little of the milk, is then poured in. It
is put in a warm place (the temperature must not
be under 70°), and in two or three hours it will
have set. The process is one of fermentation: the
milk is leavened. The first leaven of yourt, they
say, was brought by Gabriel to Abraham. They,
however, profess to be able to make it anew by repeating
the above process during a fortnight, using
on the first occasion a crab pounded in vinegar, or
a silver spoon or button: I have succeeded in obtaining
it without either the crab or the spoon. Milk
after being brought to the boiling point, was allowed
to sour; a spoonful of it was mixed on the second
day, that again on the third, and so on till the fourteenth,
when perfect yourt was obtained.</p>

<p>When staying at Lamlin in Hungary, I used to
have yourt sent over from Belgrade: the Germans
were very glad to get it, but had no idea of making
it for themselves. So travellers from all countries
of Europe have become acquainted with it, and learn
its value as an economical food and its qualities as
a healthy diet. Most of them like it, some of them
give it the preference over everything else; yet no
one has thought of introducing it at home. In Greece,
before and during the revolution, it was, like baths,
common use. “Civilization” came, and a wholesome
food and a healthful practice were straightway
expelled.</p>

<p>This species of curd, without the aid of the liquid
found in the rennet of young animals, offers the explanation
of practices of the Greeks, and suggests the
possibility of unknown uses even of milk. The Greeks
had cheese—or substances to which they applied that
name—not made with rennet, and of which the description
applies equally to yourt.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_180"></a><a href="#footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></span>
Their name for
cheese, <ins title="tyros" lang="el">τυρὸς</ins>, is supposed to be derived from Tyre:
the Indian name for <dfn>yourt</dfn> is <dfn>tyre</dfn>. The Hindoos
would not touch anything prepared with rennet. The
Greeks made curd by vinegar,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_181"></a><a href="#footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></span>
pepper, burnt salt, the
flowers of bastard saffron, and the threads on the
head of the artichoke.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_182"></a><a href="#footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>Next to yourt comes <dfn>caïmac</dfn>: it is not, however,
to us equally a stranger. The first day I spent in
Devonshire was occupied in a discussion respecting
the Phœnician settlements. It was maintained by
several learned natives that of these there was no
<em>direct</em> proof. The next morning, walking with one
of these gentlemen, we entered a cottage. “There,”
I said, pointing to the fire, upon which some Devonshire
cream was preparing, “is what you wanted last
night.” There was an Eastern dish made in an
Eastern manner—the earthenware pots and
wood-fires:<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_183"></a><a href="#footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></span>
the cottage was built of <em>tapia</em>. The name
of the adjoining village was <em>Torr</em>; direct proof why
every second name is Hebrew. Besides the village
there is <em>Tor</em>quay, <em>Tor</em>bay, <em>Tor</em> Abbey. To the eastward
there is <em>Sud</em>bury; and, if that name be not
derived from the ancient metropolis of Phœnicia, no
one will dispute the derivation of <dfn>Marazion</dfn> (Great
Zion) from the Jewish metropolis. <dfn>Beer</dfn>-Ferrers and
<dfn>Beer</dfn> Alsten are Hebrew for the Well of Ferrers, the
Well of Alsten. Then there is the <dfn>Menar</dfn> rock, the
river <dfn>Camel</dfn>, and so many
more.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_184"></a><a href="#footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></span> Sir Richard Carew
describes, in his day, mattings for hanging <em>upon the
walls</em>:<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_185"></a><a href="#footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></span>
they are precisely so used in Barbary. The
Moorish house is the fac-simile of that of ancient
Judæa; we may expect, then, to find a Phœnician
dish in villages which retain Phœnician names, and
are built according to the Phœnician fashion, and
were covered, as late as the seventeenth century, with
Phœnician matting.</p>

<p>Devonshire cream is made by heating the milk
in a pan upon the fire, then allowing it to stand;
the creamy and caseous parts collect on the top, and
the watery part is drained off below. It may then
be churned into butter: the “scalded cream of the
East” is made by a similar process. The milk is
poured into small shallow earthenware basins, which
are put in the oven with a slow heat: the lighter
part rises, and crusts. Gradually it hardens and
thickens, until, by gathering up the whole substance,
it forms a little dome. It is then lifted off like a
cake, and a little colourless fluid remains at the bottom.
This cream derives its name from the process
of making it, <dfn>caïmac</dfn>, which means
<dfn>burnt</dfn>.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_186"></a><a href="#footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>“Cream” has in Latin the same meaning: it could
not, therefore, have been originally applied as at
present, and the first cream the European nations
who employed the word had seen must have been
“burnt;”—that is, caïmac. It was probably invented
during the Crusades. All the nations of Europe use
this word. It follows, that none of them could originally
have had it; for, in that case, they would
have had an original one. Spain is, however, an
exception: the Spaniards did not take part in the
Crusades.</p>

<p>Professor Ritter has made use of this art in tracing
the ancient Scythians, and W. Von Humboldt has in
like manner employed it in his remarkable work on
the Basques. This is high tribute to the value of
cookery in the profoundest inquiries; but the results
show that, before it can be safely or successfully
employed, philosophers must be cooks. Ritter confounds
cheese and butter;<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_187"></a><a href="#footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></span>
assumes, on the strength
of the passage of Hippocrates,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_188"></a><a href="#footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></span>
on which I have above
commented, butter to be a Scythian name, and butter
to have been made by the Scythians. He then connects
the Scythian compound from mares’ milk with
the butter used as a medicine in Greece, which we
know was made from cows’ milk, and the source of
which I have already given. He does not trace any
of the parallel words, or show a Scytho-German origin
for “cream,” “milk,” “cheese,” &amp;c.</p>

<p>Humboldt considers his case to be fully made out,
and says that the same thing holds with the
Iberians;<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_189"></a><a href="#footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></span>
but, as to whether we are to infer that the
Iberians were Scythians or Germans, he does not
explain. He refers to no one term in use, or to any
practice. We have seen that cream has no native
name in any European dialect; that the name for
butter in every land expresses gee, not churned butter;
and the same thing holds even of the Tartars
and Chinese, who, like the Slaavs, call it “cows’ oil.”
The Spanish peninsula is an exception, and exhibits,
not only one, but two systems of its own.</p>

<p>The Spanish has original words for cream and butter;
the first is <dfn>nata</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_190"></a><a href="#footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></span>
the second <dfn>manteca</dfn>. Manteca
means also fat, so that it could not have been
with them primitive: they do not use it now, save as
an imported habit.</p>

<p>In the Basque provinces it is indigenous, as among
the tribes of the Zahara, and for the dairy, in all
its branches, they have original terms: milk is <dfn>eznea</dfn>,
butter <dfn>guria</dfn>, and cream <dfn>bicaño</dfn>. These terms are
wholly distinct from Aramean, Greek, Scythian, German,
or Celt. Between the north and south of the
peninsula the difference in practice coincides with
the difference of its terms; and both prove that
two distinct people anciently inhabited it. It was
next to impossible that such primitive terms should
have been lost. The things were unknown to the
Romans, and the words introduced to supplant them
were not Roman. (<dfn>Nata</dfn> is an adaptation of the
Latin <i lang="la">natare</i>.) More is not wanted to confirm the
statement of Strabo, that the “<dfn>Hispani</dfn> restrict the
term <dfn>Iberia</dfn> to the portion bounded by the river Iber.”
The two races were Hispani and Iberi.</p>

<p>Connected with this subject is another peculiarity
worth mentioning. The Greeks had two names for
bread; the one the vulgar name, which I have already
traced to the Brebers, and which is preserved in the
modern dialect of Greece and of Andalusia, in <ins title="psômi" lang="el">ψῶμι</ins>
and <dfn>acemite</dfn>. The other is <dfn>artos</dfn> (<ins title="artos" lang="el">ἄρτος</ins>). Now this
word is pure Basque, and is found in a variety of
compounds in their tongue. They have two words
for bread, <dfn>artoa</dfn> and <dfn>oguia</dfn>: the first at present
applied to maize, the second to barley; but the first is
the primitive, being derived from “grinding with a
stone;”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_191"></a><a href="#footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></span>
and as supplying the word for “dough,”
<dfn>artaoria</dfn> (<dfn>orea</dfn>, mass). They have <dfn>artochiquia</dfn>, <dfn>artopella</dfn>
for different preparations of flour. Now it may
be asked, could the Greeks derive so primitive a word
as “bread” from the Basques?<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_192"></a><a href="#footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></span>
The explanation is
given, by Socrates: “The Greeks had many words
from the barbarians who were <em>before them</em>;” and the
Basques were not always confined to the north of
Spain. We know that they colonized Sicily, and
traces of the language are to be found on the shores
of the Euxine.</p>

<p>The settlement of the Celts in Italy was coeval with
Rome. If they had known cream and used butter, the
Romans must have had them: their ornaments, their
bedding, the square and lozenge patterns, their soap,
&amp;c., are known to us. The words and usages are thus
not to be considered as belonging to their common
race, but as derived from the incidents of their own
adventures.</p>

<p>In Gaelic, or more properly
<dfn>Erse</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_193"></a><a href="#footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></span> the word for
butter comes nearer to that of the Old Testament
than the word employed by the Moors and Jews in
Barbary. It is <dfn>fin</dfn>: in the genitive case it is the
same as the Hebrew, <dfn>fine</dfn>. They have a second
word which approaches equally to the Semetic gee.
It is <dfn>ce</dfn>. This appears to be the oiled butter which
has now fallen into disuse.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_194"></a><a href="#footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></span>
Like the ancients they
used it medicinally, and kept it till it was rancid.
This is the third kind of butter known; and they
have a third name, <dfn>butter</dfn>. This word they got
where they got <dfn>fin</dfn> and <dfn>ce</dfn>. The medicinal use of
butter has in these days been reduced to one spot
of Africa—that is, Suz; and thence a traffic in it
is carried on to Negroland, just as formerly it must
have been exported from the whole coast of Barbary
to Europe. This preparation is known to-day in
the interior of Africa—precisely in the region where
neither European nor Roman, nor Greek, could have
spread it—as <dfn>Budra</dfn>. The word is given, and the
substance described, in Jackson’s Vocabulary of the
Shelloh dialect.</p>

<p>I have already shown that Pliny did not know
whence the Romans had the word, and they never
had the thing. The clans derived it directly from
Barbary or Judæa hundreds of years before Pliny
wrote. I need not here repeat what I have elsewhere
said regarding the transposition of cognate
letters. <i>D</i> and <i>T</i> are such. In adding, according
to the Greek and Roman fashion, their termination,
they would for euphony say, Butyron for
Budron.</p>

<p>Cheese in Erse, is
<dfn>Caise</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_195"></a><a href="#footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></span> pronounced Caishee.
This, too, is supposed to come from the Romans, and
the probability of this derivation is increased by
Pliny’s statement, that the barbarians had no cheese;
but we know that the Greeks had their cheese from
the Phœnicians, since the word <ins title="tyron" lang="el">τύρον</ins> is explained at
least, as Tyrian. Phrygia exported even cheese of
asses’ milk.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_196"></a><a href="#footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></span>
The old Arabs had a cheese of goats’
milk, not learnt from the Romans, for it had another
name, <dfn>Raïb</dfn>. It is clear, then, that the Semetic races
did not know the use of cheese, though, perhaps, as
at present, they were not partial to it, and did not
excel in making it. In the interior of Africa they
do make cheese, and in the dialect of the great interior
tribe extending from Morocco to the Red Sea,
the name is <dfn>agees</dfn>. It is given in the French and
Breber dictionaries.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_197"></a><a href="#footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></span>
The nearest approach the Romans
could have made to agees would be <dfn>acaseus</dfn>:
their word is <dfn>caseus</dfn>. There is no need of the intervention
of Rome to bring caise to the Celtic tribes.</p>

<p>In respect to the manufacture of butter by the
clans;—even without the aid of etymology we must
carry it to times long antecedent to its use in Europe.
It is associated with their
superstitions<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_198"></a><a href="#footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></span>—that is,
their mythological era. They make it by the process
still in use in Barbary from the whole
milk,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_199"></a><a href="#footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></span>
as well as by that now employed in the north of
Europe, from cream thrown up cold. They eat it
mixed with sweetmeats and honey; and this practice
is no less peculiar still in some parts of the East
than in the Highlands.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_200"></a><a href="#footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></span>
Preserves may be traced
back to the immediate progeny of Abraham. Jacob
sends down to Egypt a present for Joseph. It is
the choice things of the land, of course, and things
not common in Egypt. The first is balm, the second
honey;<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_201"></a><a href="#footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></span>
but honey could be no rarity in Egypt.
The word in Hebrew is <dfn>dipsi</dfn>. That is the name
still in use for preserves made of grapes; and in
Shaw’s time, the village of Hebron alone exported
annually three hundred camel loads of it to
Egypt.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_202"></a><a href="#footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></span>
There being no grapes in the Highlands, the clans
took to other fruit, not forgetting the oranges they
had been accustomed to in Spain. Butter—that I
mean in present use—being a preparation of cream,
and cream being, as I have shown, of very recent
invention, and not yet traced to its source; the
principal evidence of the originality of butter among
the clans, must rest on the proof of their having
been in possession of cream, and this, I think, I can
establish most satisfactorily. I have said that the
word cream is not known to them. Now, they have
for it two rare names: <dfn>hachdar</dfn>, which, like the
nata of the Spaniards, means the “part that swims,”
and <dfn>barr</dfn>, which signifies “top.” Skimmed milk
they call <dfn>bainne lòm</dfn>, or milk “bare” or “naked;”
they have also a term for “milk under cream,”
which is <dfn>bainne ce</dfn>, or <dfn>bainne fo che</dfn>. It is impossible
that so many, so comprehensive, and such descriptive
terms, all of them ancient, should have
been in use, if the substance to which they apply
was not known, and if the invention had not been
original. And this is remarkable, that while the
names of the preparations in use in Judæa may
etymologically be traced to domestic tongues, all the
names for this one, which is not to be found in the
east, are pure Celtic. Cream is a constituent part
of the national food, and is so general, that the very
dishes of the dinner-service have been modified to
suit it. Dessert plates are like small soup plates,
as it is the necessary accompaniment of every sweet
dish.</p>

<p>They have the Eastern caïmac in the shape of
Devonshire cream. It is known as “Carstorphine
cream,” but it is going out of use. In the village
which has given to it its Lowland name, it is no
longer to be found, although the last generation of
Edinburgh citizens used to repair thither on festal
days to regale themselves all unconsciously on this
Phœnician dainty.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_203"></a><a href="#footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>In Turkey neither of the Semetic words for
butter has been adopted: they have an original one,—like
the mantica of the Spaniards. It is <dfn>yagh</dfn>.
It applies equally to butter, fat, and oil; the last
they call <dfn>zeïtin yaga</dfn>, “olive-butter;” and butter
they sometimes qualify by <dfn>jost</dfn>, or “milk-butter.”
They, therefore, had none of their own; but I refer
to their word from a singular coincidence with
the Erse, in which language “tallow” is <dfn>igh</dfn>. It is
at present pronounced <dfn>ce</dfn>, but the orthography is a
record of a more ancient pronunciation. The great
Sclavonic family is in like manner without a word
for butter. They call it
oil.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_204"></a><a href="#footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>The last point of identification with the East
which I shall adduce, is the name of the substance
which is the basis of all these compounds—<dfn>milk</dfn>.
In Erse, it is <dfn>bainne</dfn>; in Arabic, <dfn>chaleb</dfn>. Here are
not two consonants the same; to the ear there is
no trace of resemblance, yet they are from one
root, from which also come
<dfn>gala</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_205"></a><a href="#footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></span>
<dfn>lac</dfn>, and <dfn>milk</dfn>.
Bainne is derived from the Gaelic, <dfn>ban</dfn>, white. <dfn>Lebanon</dfn>
(without the Greek termination <dfn>Le ban</dfn>), is
known to have been so called from its colour, white.
Leben is sour milk in Arabic, and from the same
root as chaleb.</p>

<p>The clans are indebted to no one for their cheese;
for their name for coagulated milk is derived from the
<dfn>maw</dfn>, in which the rennet is found. It is called <dfn>a
bhinnbeach</dfn>. The stomach, or rennet, is <dfn>binid</dfn>. They
have a variety of other dishes<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_206"></a><a href="#footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></span>
and names—<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_207"></a><a href="#footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></span> so extensive,
indeed, as to lead to the inference that at some
time they must have been essentially, if not like
the tribes of the Zahara exclusively, pastoral, and
restricted for their food to the produce of the dairy.</p>

<p>The Highlanders have the greatest variety of dishes
made from milk. They have the richest dairy, and
the richest vocabulary: the words are partly derivative,
partly original, as might have been expected
from a practical and pastoral people, taking service
amongst the different nations with whom these preparations
were in use. They learned the usages of each,
and retained them, with their names, so that the
usages and the words show the Highlanders to have
been in communication with the people who had
Turkish <dfn>caïmac</dfn>, Hindoo <dfn>gee</dfn>, and Moorish <dfn>simin</dfn>;—in
other words, that they had been in the Holy Land
before Phœnician usages had been extinguished, or,
that when they were in Morocco the present habits
were to be found.</p>

<p>“It often happens, that in seeking for the origin of
a word a much wider field of inquiry opens, and if
carefully pursued, leads to unexpected conclusions,
bearing on the history, belief, manners, and customs of
primitive times, and so as to leave no doubt of the
occurrence of particular events, or of the existence of
peculiar customs, respecting which history is entirely
silent, and of the falsity of other things, handed down
undoubtingly in her pages. Etymology is the history
of the languages of nations, which is a most important
part of their general history. It is the lamp by which
that which is obscure in the primitive history of the
world will one day be lighted
up.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_208"></a><a href="#footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>It is, indeed, the lamp, but not the light. The
wick must be touched by living flame before it ignites.
That flame is custom. The pursuit of mere sound—the
affinities of roots—are but landscapes in the clouds,
until you get things substantial, with which they are
associated, and on which the light of etymology may
be brought to shine.</p>

<p>A distinction between the use of butter and oil
for simmering muffins and crumpets in Morocco, furnishes
a link between those eaten in the Temple of
Solomon and those sold in the streets of London, and
thereby supplies evidence to fix the Cassiterides,
while incidentally, it disposes of a great historical
and ethnographic question, the wanderings of the
Celts.</p>

<p>An admirable product has been used for thousands
of years in this region, and no Jason has come to
carry it away. Yet Julius Cæsar and Count Julian,
Sartorius, and Belisarius, Charles <abbr title="Five">V,</abbr>, with many other
shrewd persons, have tasted Moorish butter. The
Andalusians are delighted to get a little pot of it, but
as to learning how to make it, that never entered into
their philosophy. So yourt, made in every tent or
hut, from the Yellow Sea to the Adriatic, is unknown
in Europe. A magic line defines the domain of chops,
of boiled potatoes, of chocolate, of coffee. One race
can boil, another cannot: <i>e.g.</i> the
English.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_209"></a><a href="#footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></span> One
race can roast, another cannot; and each is utterly
incapable of comprehending the faculty conferred on
the other. There is a land congenial to pilaff, another
to kuskoussou, another to mutton-broth. Devonshire
cream, polecuta, poi curry, have, like an insect on
a moss, their zone. You may transplant trees, and
transfer royal houses, carry forth religions, and distribute
all around slips of constitutions—but a dish!—no!—as
there is more in a costume than covering
the back, so is there more in a dish than filling the
belly.</p>

<p>There yet remains one term unexamined. Whence
comes <dfn>dairy</dfn>? There is no such word on the Continent;
it is neither Latin nor Teutonic. It has no
Celtic root. I have been describing the douar, which
is indeed a camp; but the features which forced
themselves upon my attention belonged to the sheepfold.
The people are shepherds. In every tent the
chief utensils are the milk-pails, leathern churns, and
butter-pots; the chief produce and food, milk and
butter. Why is the Arab camp a circle? It is to
fold the cattle. Thence the name, douar and deïra.
The exploits of Abd-el-Kadir and his <dfn>Deïra</dfn> have made
the word familiar to us in Europe. It is the very
word we apply to the fold’s
produce.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_210"></a><a href="#footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></span> From the same
root is <dfn>gadeira</dfn>, <dfn>gadir</dfn>, an enclosure—the name of
Cadiz, the only city upon earth in which the cow or
ewe is not to be found, nor any animal whatever
giving milk! How, it may be asked, could the word
come to us? <dfn>Tally ho!</dfn> is in English an unmeaning
word. The rallying cry of the Arab in war is <dfn>Talla
hu!</dfn> Tally ho! doubtless, was brought by the Crusaders.
Dairy may have been learnt then, or many
a century before.</p>

<p>The pursuit of a word is like “hunt the slipper.”
It is here, it is there. There would be no game
unless it were slipped under. There was <i>Babia</i>, the
goddess of infants, in Phœnicia; there are <em>babies</em> in
England. No doubt it is the same slipper, though we
cannot tell under what petticoat it has slipped.</p>

<p>Sheeps’ heads, with the skin left on, are in Morocco,
as in Scotland, carried to the smithy to be singed.
“Singed heads” were never twice invented in the
world.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_211"></a><a href="#footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></span>
Things that are worth anything, are only
invented once. The crop is sown, the weeds only
come up of themselves. There is nothing without its
history, if we only knew it. Whatever is, had a
beginning. That only is worth looking for which we
do not know.</p>

 The Dutch have one of the best sweet dishes, which they
peculiarly honour by decorated booths at their fairs, set apart
for its preparation. Like the muffin, it is flour and water set
for three hours to ferment: it is then poured, not on a griddle,
but on heated tongs with deep bars, so that it comes out with the
shape of a portcullis; it is then eaten like the sfen, with sugar

<p class="footnote">“I cannot tell how the wheat is prepared, as we procure it in
a state of jelly from an old woman who knows the secret. A
pint of this jelly is melted in a quart of milk; it is slightly
boiled, lemon peel, and cinnamon, and sugar being then added;
the yolks of five eggs beaten up, are mixed in, and it is
served in a tureen. Raisins and currants, all stewed well, and
plumped out with hot water, are served up separately; they are
cold, a spoonful or so being added to each helping. The name
is <dfn>frumenty</dfn>; this shows perhaps the antiquity of the dish, and is
an interesting specimen of etymology. It is only made at

 Dr. Forbes, in his “Physician’s Holiday,” has given some
valuable suggestions on this matter:—</p>

<p class="footnote">“In looking at the horrid compound sold in England as salt
butter—at least, the cheaper sorts of it used by the poorer classes—I
cannot but believe that its supersession by the boiled butter
of Switzerland would be advantageous, both to the comfort and
health of a large proportion of our countrymen. It can hardly
be believed that such an offensive, briny, and semi-putrid mass,
as the cheaper sorts of our salt butter, can be without serious
detriment to the health of the consumers, any more than the
salted meat formerly issued to our seamen was so.”</p>

<p class="footnote">He describes a melted butter used in Switzerland, and earnestly
recommends the adoption of the same practice for culinary
purposes. It consists in boiling it slowly after it is made: the
process takes six hours, two to heat it, two to cool it, and two to
simmer it. There is a white, hard cheesy sediment which has
carefully to be removed. He also describes a process, by which
the whole of the butter of these Alpine pastures is preserved
sweet, without salt. “On a board, four or five inches wide, wooden
pins two to three feet in length, are fixed upright; the butter
is placed daily around these pins, beginning at the lower end, in
a mass not exceeding the width of the board. Every day, as
more butter is added around the pin, the diameter is gradually
enlarged, until the upper part overhangs the base, like an inverted
bee-hive. When one pin is filled, another is proceeded
with. The exposed surface of these masses gets soon covered
with a sort of hard film, which effectually excludes the air.”</p>

and condemned by the people for killing an ox. “For
this beast,” says Pliny, “is our companion, and labours together
with us in ploughing the field.” Yet in Rome everything was
based upon pasturage, not tillage: libations of milk were used
in sacrifice. <dfn>Pecunia</dfn> was money, and the public revenues

 The art of making tea consists in pouring the water
on and off immediately, so as to get the flavour. Coffee-making
is a more intricate affair, and cannot be conveyed in a
recipe. A docile spirit, that will dismiss every received idea,
and not reason, may make something out of the hints I now
submit. The fire must be very low, half embers (wood), half
ashes; the cup of coffee small; and a small pot so as to make
it cup by cup. The coffee must be slowly roasted, not burnt,
and brought only to an umber brown; it must be roasted day by
day. The flavour dissipates in a few hours; it must be reduced
by pounding to an impalpable powder. These are the conditions
under which coffee can be made. In making it, two opposite
and apparently incompatible ends are to be secured,—strength
and flavour; to obtain the first it must be boiled,—by boiling,
the second is lost. The difficulty is surmounted by a double
process; one <em>thorough</em> cooking, one <em>slight</em> one; by the first a
strong infusion is obtained, by the second that infusion is
flavoured. Thus, a large pot with coffee-lees stands simmering
by the fire; this is the <dfn>sherbet</dfn>: when a cup is wanted, the
pounded coffee is put in the little tin or copper pan and placed
on the embers; it fumes for a moment; then the sherbet is
poured on; in a few seconds the froth (caïmah) rises; presently
an indication that it is about to boil is made manifest, when the
coffee is instantly taken from the fire, and carried to the apartment,
and turned into the cup and drunk.</p>

 There is one thing new under the sun, and that is an egg
cup: no egg cups are to be found in Etruscan sepulchres, in
Egyptian pyramids, or Assyrian palaces; eggs were only boiled
hard in the shell. Small spoons, egg-, or tea-, or salt-spoons, are
also a modern discovery, and all pertain to the new meal.</p>

 One of the four-and-twenty romances of the Arabs before

with his bow an old woman who brought it. Thence arises a
tribe-encounter, in which the chief loses his life. There have
been handed down a lament by his son, and a pæan by his conqueror,
which Antar soon turned to an elegy.</p>

 The ancients used it largely as a medicine. Cows’ milk
was for this purpose not only used, but preferred as more aromatic.
It was applied externally for all diseases of the skin,
abstinence from animal food being at the same time enjoined.
It was prescribed at Rome for ague; in Arcadia it was given for
atrophy and gout; it was considered an antidote to various poisons,
and a specific for hardness of the spleen. Uncooked, it was held
to be unwholesome; a prejudice still subsisting in the East.</p>

 In the life of Cornaro it is stated, that up to the age of
forty he laboured under various diseases, which made his
existence a burden to him. He then commenced a diet of
bread and <em>milk as drawn from the animal</em>; he became robust,
vigorous, and enjoyed perfect health, for one hundred years.
Had he omitted the bread, and drunk the milk alone, he might
perhaps have drawn out his lease of life to the fabled limit of

 Humboldt derives this word from acorn. “If the edible
gland is formed in the north of Spain, and if this name (artea)
is there given to the oak that bears it, then it may be supposed
that the Basque <dfn>artoa</dfn>, comes from this and from the ancient
habit of acorn bread,” referred to by Juvenal (<abbr title="Saturnalia six">Sat. vi.</abbr> 10), “glandem
ructante marito,” this is nearer than <dfn>Aratu</dfn> to plough, or
the Greek <ins title="artos" lang="el">ἄρτος</ins>. I cannot answer for the three suppositions,
but when acorns are eaten, they are not made into bread. Juvenal
speaks of acorns, not of bread. Larramandi in his introduction,
gives the etymology I have quoted in the text; as to
deriving a Basque word from the Greek, as well might you so

 I must make a reservation in favour of Northumberland,
where I have fallen upon persons who did know how to boil.
They spoke of “seasoning” the water, and of things being
spoilt that were “knocked about” in the pot. Here was the
apprehension of the two points to be kept in view, that the
water be not hungry so as to exhaust the meat, that the bubbles
should not be generated at the bottom of the pot so as to
scorch it and harden the fibre. Any one born with the instinct
of a cook, will, however bred in prejudice, from these two hints,
gain all that is requisite. He who has not these instincts, will
not learn how to boil if a waggon load of cookery books were
shot over him. Strange it is, that the only people who have not
a conception of boiling, should alone persist, generation after
generation, in sending up to table vegetables and fish plain
boiled! Fish, however, differs from flesh in this, that the hotter it
is boiled the better; thus oil or butter, which rises to 600°
before boiling, is best for it.</p>

 The peculiarity of the “singed head” is, that the skin is
left on, which of course is connected with the manner of
slaughtering and flaying animals. The Egyptians, as Herodotus
mentions (<abbr title="liber 2 chapter">l. ii. c.</abbr> 38), “cut off the head and then
skin the body.” He says that no Egyptian will eat the head
of any animal, which Wilkinson contradicts (Thebes, <abbr title="volume 2, page">vol. ii. p.</abbr>
232), because a mendicant receives one: this rather confirms than
confutes the assertion.</p>

<h4 class="h4head"><span class="allsmcap">DEPARTURE FROM RABAT.</span></h4>

<p class="p2">I never had greater difficulties of the kind to encounter,
than in getting away from Rabat. Ali Bey,
in the narration of his pilgrimage, mentions that,
after starting from some place, the whole caravan
commenced a violent dispute about the loading of
the animals; after lasting about two hours, it suddenly
ceased. On inquiring the cause of this phenomenon,
it was told him, that from such a place to
such a place, “the Arabs dispute.” Our dispute had
no limits, save those of the journey. A large party
accompanied us across the water to the Salee side,
and a slave of Mustafa Ducali’s privately suggested
that it was a great pity that I should go away,
that it was better to stay at Rabat than to go. “If
you stay,” said he, “you will have a nice house
like my master’s, and two or three pretty wives, the
daughters of caïds.”</p>

<p>We left the beach about two o’clock, turning to
the right to avoid Salee: we passed through one of
the gates of its old walls, enclosing the ancient
harbour; turning again to the left, we passed between
the gardens and the back of the city. When
opposite one of the gates, we sent in for corn to
carry with us, and I was much tempted to enter the
forbidden city, but contained myself, not to commence
dissensions with the guard at the very moment
of starting.</p>

<p>Rambling on while the guard awaited the messenger,
we came on a cleft in the rock, the bottom
occupied by an orange grove, most inviting, with its
green lustre and deep shadow, cool, damp, dark, and
fragrant. To this retreat, many a seafarer has returned
to enjoy the fruits of his industry: how many
a tender “Rover,” has been here formed by listening
to his sire’s tales of Maltese galleys, Christian argosies
and Andalusian maids. While we were looking from
the backs of our horses over the wall that ran along
the edge of the cliff, the proprietor came up, and
invited us to descend: there was nothing piratical
about him, so we yielded. The first flight of steps
brought us to a small tank, covered with a trellis of
vines, surrounded by a little walk, through which
there were grooves for the water to circulate, without
wetting your feet, and it fell from all sides into
the tank in little cascades. At one side there
was a little kiosk with a window opening upon the
orange grove below. Here we found a party of
Moors seated in one corner, and the inseparable tea-things
in the other. My host hurried me down, and
walked me all over the grounds, gathering sweet
and bitter lemons and oranges, and seemingly
anxious to stock me with a supply of every variety.
Suddenly, having got me alone, he stopped, and
with ominous signs and emphasis, pronounced the
word <em>Serser</em>! I was now in my turn anxious to
know what he had to say, and wished to call a Jew
I had got as an interpreter; but this he would not
suffer, and seemed to expect to succeed in making me
understand by speaking very close to my ear:—he
was much opposed to the working of mines, and
apprehensive of my safety. When I admired in
one place the culture of the garden, he said, “this is
the ‘Madem’ (mines) of the Arabs;” he then asked
me to stay some days at Tangier, and he would
come and see me there. On taking leave, he insisted
on walking with me a quarter of a mile, till I was
outside of the aqueduct, and in the open country,
and gave me the name of a person at Larache,
to whose house he desired me to go. This person
was absent on my arrival there.</p>

<p>Towards sunset we entered a douar, without asking
anybody’s leave, and pitched in the middle of it without
a question being asked us by any one: the change
was as great as if one had fallen through from one
century into another, yet all external objects were
precisely the same. There were, however, only so
many cottagers living in tents: we had entered a
village, not a douar. Had I gone from Tangier to
Rabat by land, I should, by passing through these
successive changes, have become gradually familiarized
with them; fortunately I had seen the southern country.
Everything in this douar was for sale at extortionate
prices, each bargain accompanied by great
squabbling. The Sheik did come, and did bring,
as a present, a jar of milk. This was all that recalled
to me the tribes to the south.</p>

<p>Early the next day we arrived at Medea. Lying
on the edge of a ravine, we were almost at the gate
before we saw it. Like the other towns, it is built
at the estuary of a river, which descending through a
chasm, has carved out through the rock and sand, its
way to the ocean, where, met by a heavy surge, it
heaps up a bar, which the waves incessantly lash.</p>

<p>The fortress is a parallelogram. The contents in
people, and in value, could not be equal to a douar.
Below and between the town and the river, there is
an enclosure of walls in the form of a rectangle, and
about four hundred yards long: the walls are in Tapia,
and vary from twenty to forty feet in height, and from
five to seven in thickness. Seen from above, it appears
like a labyrinth; there are large square spaces and passages
running round them; the interval between the
walls is at times not greater than their own thickness;
there are no windows or doors, or the spring of arches
for covering in. Bare dead walls compose the vast
chambers, or narrow passages; a small aperture is
seen here and there, by which a man might creep
through. There is a Moorish gateway, but it is a
modern addition. Being outside the fortress, and
under it, this building could not have been intended
in any way for defence. It was neither a reservoir for
water, nor a store for merchandize. The deputy
governor who accompanied me was perfectly certain
that it was built by Christians: when I expressed
doubts, he became angry, and vociferated loudly,
“Eusara,” “Romani.” It was so fresh, that the walls
might have been just finished or still in process of
construction.</p>

<p>I found the caïd superintending the mending of an
oar. He reiterated his salutations of welcome at
least a dozen times (it has to be repeated three
times) and pressed me to stay that night, or at all
events to dine. We, however, were anxious to get
on, and the cattle were conducted down to the
boat, while the caïd sent his deputy—who, like himself,
every inch a Moor, is a negro in complexion,
but whose features are European—to conduct me over
the building I have already noticed.</p>

<p>We intended here to get if possible fresh horses,
not less on account of the wretched quality of those
we had, than of the annoyance we suffered from their
owners. After they had received their money, they
wanted to decline performing the journey, and when
I expressed surprise, they answered, “We have no
law—we have no flag: we are neither Mussulmans,
Jews, nor Christians.” This answer I comprehended,
knowing them to be Oudaïas, a tribe broken and
dispersed, and holding no ties with the world, its
enemy—a Poland of the Desert.</p>

<p>The boat in which we crossed was about forty feet
by ten, pulled by a couple of oars. Their ingenuity
had not arrived at making a platform for embarking
cattle. The camels stride in fastly enough, and stow
easily: they are made to crouch down head and tail,
and a row of their strange heads projects over both
sides. Getting in the horses is a laborious operation:
they have to be unladen, and then walked
into the water, and beaten until they spring in, first
getting their fore-legs into the boat, and then with
a second spring their hind-legs: some of them, however,
are very expert. Our horses had to perform
this operation four times between Rabat and Tangier—at
Rabat, Medea, Larache, and Arzila.</p>

<p>Just as we had got our cattle embarked, the caïd
was seen on horseback winding his way down the
rock. We put back to take him in; and he came
into the stern, where we were seated upon our baggage,
carrying in his hand a handkerchief containing
a large provision of hard-boiled eggs. He said, “As
you would not stay to eat, I had these boiled that
you might not be hungry on the way.” One of the
packages of majoon appearing amongst the baggage,
the conversation turned upon that composition; and
he told me that he was then going, in consequence
of an order he had received that morning from
the Sultan, to gather for him roots, from which another
and superior kind of majoon was made, and
which were only to be found at an hour’s distance
from whence we were, and if we would wait for him
at a certain well, he would himself bring a specimen
of the plant. As soon as we reached the indicated
place, he appeared on the hill above, coming
towards us at full speed, and presented me with one
of the roots, which was like a large parsnip: it appears
to be the plant called surnag by Leo Africanus.
He had also the consideration to bring some of the
leaves, that I might recognise it again. I forgot to
ask the mode of preparing it, which I have since been
unable to ascertain, as it is not used by the people;
though the most strange stories are told of its effects.
It is said to have been discovered by the Emperor
Ismael, and to its use is attributed the numerous
progeny of that sovereign, reported at sixty births
per month.</p>

<p>The Seboo is the largest river of the kingdom of
Fez; it is here about half a mile in width: the bar
is so fierce as to be wholly impassable. It rises in
the Atlas, and passes near Fez and through Mequinez.
A branch of it passes through the city of Fez: it is
there termed the “river of pearls,” and was formerly
called the “river of gold.” It was once navigable as
far as Fez, and it still has all the appearance of being
so; yet the corn is carried thither to be ground at
an expense of transport exceeding its value, and then
the flour is carried back again, for at Fez they seem
to have good mill-stones, and do not use the common
sand-grit. But, probably, the navigation of the stream
has been purposely disused, in pursuance of their
standing policy of closing the door against Europeans,
and sacrificing the advantages of the present to security
for the future.</p>

<p>The Seboo, more than any other river in Morocco,
abounds with the shabel; that of Azimore is the
finest in quality. It is about the size of a salmon,
which it resembles: the flesh is soft, fat, and delicate,
and those who have tasted the kiran of the Lake
of Ochrida have eaten something that recalls it. The
Seboo bore signs of passing through a chalk country,
showing that the region around had still all the aspect
of the Zahel. The river, while we crossed it, was
covered with bees that were dropping in. There are
thousands of hives in the neighbourhood: the bees
were perishing in great quantities from its being a
foggy morning.</p>

<p>A broad and level beach of sand bordered the
river, and exhibited a beautiful pattern in colours,
resembling that Moorish ornament which is at once
the richest and the commonest. On pointing it out
to one of those who were with me, he exclaimed,
“That is the figure on the Tower of Hassan.” It
is so remarkable that it must have been imitated in
their buildings. It is produced by there being sands
of different colours, which also vary in size and
specific gravity. Each warp of a wave sets them in
motion, and then deposits them with mathematical
precision. The river abounds with black sparkling
grains of iron, which they use for dusting on their
writing: this was the first time we had seen it. To
the south there was no lime: the iron on the surface
is red, being oxide: here the chalk commenced, and
the iron is carbonate. Besides this, there are three
or four sands of different shades of yellow and red,
falling into different portions of the patterns. There
is the blue,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_212"></a><a href="#footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></span>
brown, and yellow figure, as if laid on
with a touch or stamped with a block. This beach
presents at once the origin of the peculiar Moorish
tracery and colouring, with which no other style has
anything to compare.</p>

<p>That night we encamped in a douar, which was
near the southern extremity of the long marsh or
lake, El Marga, which runs parallel to the sea. As
we passed along its placid waters, we had on the left
the incessant roar of the ocean, which we never saw.
From the sea, the country must appear a perfectly
barren waste; and yet, at the back of the cliffs,
there was a vale of forty miles thickly peopled and
well cultivated. The lake seemed very shallow, and
was so covered with waterfowl that they might have
been rained upon it. We saw some boats, not pulled
with oars, but punted. The lake varied in width
from one mile to five. The douars were close to
each other all along its banks on both sides; but,
on the side on which we were, the tents might be
seen in lines, or irregularly scattered. They had
seines and cast-nets, and the fish was chiefly a very
fat but flavourless barbel. They did not shoot the
water-fowl, but caught them with gins of horse-hair,
into which they ran their necks while swimming.
The swans, in one place seen from a great distance,
appeared like a white streak: we could scarcely believe
they were birds till we came near. Next to
that on the Lake of Mexico, I imagine that this is
the largest collection of waterfowl on earth.</p>

<p>That night, when our people were at supper, there
was an attempt made to carry off one of our horses.
The alarm was given, not by the dogs, which only
barked as usual, but by the women, who set up a
frightful yelling—the classic <em>ululatus</em>. We had
pitched a little way from the tents to avoid the noise.
After this, men were drafted from the douar to sleep
and watch all round us. The robbers were suspected
to be of the tribe of Azamor, near Mequinez, two of
which tribe were sitting at supper with our people
at the very time.</p>

<p>The whole of the next day we travelled along the
shore of the lake. We had in sight before us a
range of hills, one of which was covered with snow;
and here snow upon a mountain in the middle of
winter is the sign of a greater height than it would
be with us in the middle of summer. I performed
most of the journey on foot, wearing only shirt and
drawers; and I got away from the party that I might
have a better chance of seeing the people, and I always
met with the utmost kindness. They were always
surprised that I was on foot, but never that I was
alone. I was invited to their tents; or they would
come running from a distance, bringing milk. I was
amused with the alertness with which they always
set to work to teach me Arabic words.</p>

<p>About sunset, and after travelling ten hours, we
came to the head of the lake, and chose for pitching,
a sward on a projecting angle running into it, and
some hundred yards from a douar. This was the
first time that we got away from the tents, and I revelled
in recalling the night’s repose of Eastern travel.
The Arabs came and helped us to pitch; brought
us all we required, and then made a blazing fire of
cork-bark. As the night closed in, the water-fowl
near us in the angle of the lake, came swimming
in to a clump of bulrushes not fifty yards distant,
just as tame ducks might do. There is abundance
of boars in the neighbourhood; and the Sheik offered
to turn out with all his tribe if I would stay or return
for a day’s hunting.</p>

<p>Next morning, while the animals were lading, I
strayed along the water’s edge, and was suddenly
assailed by a rush of dogs from the tents. With my
back to the water, I defended myself with a stick
for some time.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_213"></a><a href="#footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></span>
Presently, a woman and a girl
ran down from the tents to the rescue; and after
belabouring the dogs, and setting me free, they
seemed overjoyed with their exploit, ejaculating incessantly,
“Eh, Nazarene!” examining me all over,
feeling my hair and skin, and bursting into fits of
laughter. Our conversation, if not <i lang="fr">spirituelle</i>, was
lively. When the interpreter came up, I learnt that
my deliverer was the wife of the Sheik: she was
a comely middle-aged woman, with a head to delight
a phrenologist. She said she had a question to ask
me, if I would answer her. On my promising to do
so, she resumed: “You have come to our country,
and seen it: now, tell me which is best, your country
or ours?” I answered her, “God is the father of
all men, and the maker of all lands, and he has given
to his children the land that best suits each: your
country is good for you, and ours for us.” I in my
turn proposed a question:—“In your country, which
is a good country, tell me what is the best thing?”
She reflected, and said, “We have no good things.”
I then asked, “What are your bad things?” She
answered, “God’s evils.” The explanation was, “old
age and bad weather.” I told her that, if she had
seen my country, she would know that with them
the one was rare and the other late. She then
asked how much I had seen of their country; and
having told her that I had been into Shavoya, and
amongst the Ziaides, she began to expatiate on her
own tribe. “God,” she said, “has given us a fertile
and a pretty land; he has given us plain, and forest,
and marsh; he has put a sea beyond the hills, that
no one should harm us; we have a lake that has
fish and birds; we have cattle, sheep, milk, and
butter; we have reeds, honey, and firewood; we
have corn in store, and gold and silver; and, if we
live under tents, and not in the city, it is because
we choose it.” Our conversation was put an end to
by the rest of the tribe thronging around us; and
an old woman entertaining, or pretending, great alarm,
a little pantomime was suddenly improvised. The
Sheik formally announced that they had in their
tents a slave escaped from England, whom it was
their intention to deliver up that I might take her
away, upon which they recounted her services and
merits to show how useful a slave she was that they
were giving up—and one of her services was to supply
the douar with wild sows’ milk. On this the old
woman ran for her life, and all the children after
her: she was, however, caught, brought back, and
delivered up, and by this time our horses were laden
and we took our leave.</p>

<p>Nothing can exceed the richness of the women’s
hair—it falls like clusters of black grapes or knots
of snakes: it is plaited on both sides of the head,
and falls behind. They increase its volume by silk
or worsted cords; and I could not help thinking that
the hair of the women of Carthage was not so despicable
a substitute for standing rigging, especially if
they used, as the Jewesses to-day, a turban of silk
thread (<dfn>shoualif</dfn>) made to imitate it.</p>

<p>I here saw one of the boats. It was certainly the
great grandfather of skiffs; the hollow tree, or monoxyllo,
is to it a modern invention. It was simply
a bundle of rushes tied together, and raised at the
point like an Indian canoe, with “thwarts,” to keep
it hollow: it was open at the stern, and floated
merely by the buoyancy of the rushes. It had nothing
in the form of fastening; no rulucks; and was propelled
by a pole. I now saw <em>the</em>
“basket”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_214"></a><a href="#footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></span> in which
the mother of Moses placed her child, and which
does not exactly tally with the notions of Poussin and
Guercino. The name of the rushes is <dfn>scaif</dfn>, and that
is the Arabic for ship. When I heard it before, I
thought it must have been derived from the Greek
<ins title="skaphê" lang="el">σκάφη</ins>, which again is derived
from <ins title="skaptô" lang="el">σκάπτω</ins>, to hollow
out; whence also <ins title="skaptêr" lang="el">σκαπτὴζ</ins>, a digger,
<ins title="skaphê" lang="el">σκάφη</ins>, a ditch.
If this be so, then the Arabs, in borrowing their word
from the Greeks, proceeded to call by the same name
a plant spread over the whole land; displacing the
ancient name—which it must have had, as also the
roots made from it, a thousand years—and before the
Greek islands were visited by Cadmus. If this is
too absurd, then the Arabs called the boats after
the reed, and the Greeks, adopting from them the
name, constructed out of it this root, their verb <em>to
hollow</em>, and all its derivatives. The modern Greeks
have not this word, but have taken the Arabic one
for caravan (<ins title="karabi" lang="el">καράβι</ins>). The Arabs have the same word
for boat and camel, <dfn>merkeb</dfn>, not because it is the
“ship of the desert,” but because it is “mounted.”</p>

<p>The Highlander calls a beehive <dfn>scape</dfn>, the French,
<dfn>ruche</dfn>: the English “skiff” and “ship,” the German
“schiff,” come all from <dfn>skaff</dfn>. The Portuguese preserve
the old Greek word <dfn>naus</dfn>. <dfn>Bastimento</dfn> and
<dfn>bâtiment</dfn> are from <dfn>beit</dfn>, a house or building; and
our sea-terms generally come from the Arabic. The
aloe is called <dfn>kordean</dfn>, which applies equally to the
plant and to the fibres extracted from it. Thence
we may have got the <dfn>Gordian</dfn> knot. At all events, it
is good as an etymon for <dfn>cord</dfn>. Their word for cord
is <dfn>kenab</dfn>, from which the Greeks and Romans took
their name for hemp. The continental name for
pitch (<dfn>alkitran</dfn>, Spanish; <dfn>goudron</dfn>, French) is from
<dfn>kitran</dfn>; hammock, from <dfn>hamaca</dfn> (Hebrew); cable, from
<dfn>habl</dfn> (Arabic). The Greek word for boat-fare, <ins title="naulos" lang="el">ναῦλος</ins>,
is from the Arabic <dfn>naulbabi</dfn>, mother of
harbours.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_215"></a><a href="#footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></span>
<dfn>Frigate</dfn> is mentioned as a Moorish name for longboats
by a writer at the beginning of the last century,
who says, “We call them
brigantines.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_216"></a><a href="#footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></span> Brigantine
or breck, seems to come from <dfn>coffee-pot</dfn>; <dfn>ibrek</dfn>, a
coffee-pot. <dfn>Corvette</dfn> is also
Phœnician.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_217"></a><a href="#footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></span> An Arab
sailor mentioning the different winds, called the
sirocco, shiloh. The same term is applied to the
southern Brebers, which therefore designates the
country from which they came, and makes the sirocco
a derivative from the Arabic. Again, <dfn>dabét</dfn>, which
they give to compasses, their compasses being made
like our boats’ davits. The new French dictionary
of the dialect of Algiers has the following words:
<dfn>spaolon</dfn>, twine; <dfn>dmane</dfn>, helm; <dfn>saboura</dfn>, ballast. The
Greek for twine is <ins title="spaon" lang="el">σπάον</ins>. The French, Italian, Greek,
Spanish, &amp;c., for helm is <dfn>timon</dfn> or <dfn>timoni</dfn>, and the
common Levant term for ballast is <dfn>savoura</dfn>.</p>

<p>After quitting the lake we ascended a hill, and
passed by a saint’s tomb. I had not been so close to
one before, and was surprised at their not leading
me away from it. There were quantities of rushes
lying around for sleeping on, and I found that it was
a common practice for travellers to sleep there, as in
the Heroa of Greece, where they were always secure.
They even asked me if I had ever slept in one, so
that the fanaticism of the towns is here unknown.</p>

<p>The snow-white saints’ tombs are very beautiful,
seen across the lakes, and reflected in them. The
resemblance was striking with the Mussulman tombs
of India. The half-globe is placed on the cube, and
within the spandril the Gothic arch. Whether was
the Indian building derived from the Moorish, or this
from the Indian; for as yet, as in the other parts
of Moorish architecture, I had not seen any natural
type or human work from which it could be derived.
The tents, however, had now assumed a new form,
and looked like cottages, being closed in at the
bottom by mats of reeds, made into hurdles, over
which the tent itself stood, like a roof. The population
is here more stationary. In the centre of the
circle the mosque, instead of being a tent, was constructed
with reeds, like a tall beehive; and, as they
have no carpenters, the entrance was by a round
hole, three feet from the ground, to prevent the
entrance of pigs, cattle, sheep, or poultry, which might
defile it.</p>

<p>As we advanced, we found numbers of these beehives,
sometimes one to each tent, and used as dormitories
for the children.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_218"></a><a href="#footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></span>
While I was considering the
origin of the tombs, I observed one of these cones,
against which a square hurdle had been placed to
close the orifice, and there was in rushes the perfect
model of the stone building.</p>

<p>The round hole is the origin of the horse-shoe arch,
which is a circle slit down. The walls of the tombs
are finished off with the ornaments, to represent the
obtruding ends of the reeds in the hurdles. I was
confirmed in this supposition when, on asking the
name of the reeds, I was answered, <dfn>Kasob</dfn>, which is
the name of a fortress, <span class="place">Kasaba</span>. The first fortresses,
or stocades, were of course constructed of reeds. I
beheld in these shining edifices on the borders of
this marsh, the rudiment of the swelling dome on the
banks of the Tiber, and the type of the mausolea of
Akbar and Jhanju, on those of the Indus. In their
substance they are the very root of all building, as in
their forms they are of all architecture.</p>

<p>I must refer the reader to what I have said elsewhere
on Moorish and Gothic architecture.</p>

<p>From our early studies probably no more pleasing
impressions remain than those connected with the
funereal solemnities of the ancients. The feeling they
convey goes home to the mind, and the manner in
which it is expressed, and the ceremonies, rites, and
laws connected with it, take possession of our youthful
imaginations. Indeed, funeral rites constitute in
a great degree our idea of the life of antiquity, as
funeral monuments furnish the largest proportion of
its records. But, if we are thus moved in reading of
what existed thousands of years ago, and are made
to partake in the, to us, strange veneration that consecrated
the tomb into a
temple<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_219"></a><a href="#footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a></span>—that converted it
into a sanctuary for the criminal—that made it
sacrilege to tread upon the
grave<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_220"></a><a href="#footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></span>—that enjoined
the utmost cleanliness in the arrangements and preservation
of sepulchres, and (among the Jews) imposed
the yearly white-washing of them—how much more
so, in seeing those very practices amongst an extant
people! Treading the Continent that bears the load
of the Pyramids, the sight of these tombs suggests
other reflections: the connexion of the honour of the
dead with judgment on his acts—with recompense
and punishment, and therefore with an after-existence—with
a Creator of man, the Giver of life, the Receiver
of the soul.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_221"></a><a href="#footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></span>
They prepared for the belief in
a future state by creating for themselves a future
here; and in the treatment of their mortal remains
lay punishments and rewards, that surpassed any that
present things, except in this anticipation, could
furnish.</p>

<p>In after times there was a superstitious veneration
for the dead—not so in early times. The corpse was
judged by those who had witnessed its life, before it
received the <em>honours</em> of sepulture. Until this sentence
was pronounced, the body was an uncleanly
thing, and polluted those whom it touched. And
thus the denial of sepulture remained for ages the
direst of misfortunes that could befall a man, and
the darkest dishonour that could be inflicted on his
kindred. We have instances amongst the Jewish kings
of both extremes;—a sepulchre raised for a good
king above all the rest, and the ashes of a bad one
cast out from the tombs of his
ancestors.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_222"></a><a href="#footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a></span> And thus
those wonderful structures which, of the earliest ages,
will survive all that has since been constructed
on the earth, are but evidences of the reverence
paid to judgment at their death upon the lives of
men. The height of the Pyramids assumed a scale
in rating human conduct, and thereby conveyed the
transcendant worth of those whose ashes they concealed.</p>

<p>The first, the greatest structures thus rose, not to
shelter the living, but to receive the dead. I am
describing what I see around me. This land contains
no houses but for the dead. The few cities are
formed of edifices that resemble tombs, being built
upon their model, in the forms that mourning piety
had devised, and by the arts that sepulchral edifices
have preserved.</p>

<p>So also have the arts sprung from their hallowing
and judging the dead. Painting and sculpture have
their origin in the art of embalming. The covering
presented the human form; the resemblance was
completed by colour. The case that contained it was
in like manner fashioned to preserve the likeness;
and thus, in the first of solemn duties and ceremonies,
in the cerement (wax-cloth) itself, were united, in
primeval times, painting, sculpture, and carving. A
step further was, to present, instead of the corpse, the
man as alive, as reposing on, or rising out of his
tomb. These we have in Etruria, calling into being
or adopting a new art—that of the potter.</p>

<p>In the centre of Africa it is a custom among
some of the tribes for mothers who have lost young
children, to carry about with them little wooden dolls
to represent them; and to these they offer food whenever
they themselves eat. Have we not here the
origin of the <em>imagines</em> of the Romans, derived from
the Etruscans, derived by them from the Egyptians,
as by these from the Abyssinians,—beyond whom we
cannot ascend; and that people was the fellow race
to the Lybians. And here we have uninterrupted the
traditions which have floated down the Nile, crossed
the Mediterranean, and flourished so long in ancient
Europe.</p>

<p>In a region where Islamism universally prevails,
we might expect few traces of pagan ceremonies, and
here Islamism was the successor of Christianity, so that
there had twice been the sweeping away of the old
land-marks; but here, at all events, it is not a thousand
years that have made any difference—the differences
are only in so far as positive change has been
effected by some event—there has not been a perpetual
process of change going on. This people is a
true society:—the man perishes, but the society is
deathless.</p>

<p>In Barbary there are no longer the judges of the dead,
or the scales and feather. There are no longer the
games in their honour, the embalming of their bodies,
or the sacrifices to their manes. No longer are mountains
of granite piled on high, to signify their worth,
nor caverns burrowed in the rock to prevent their dust
from desecration; but still there is on the houseless
waste the house of the dead, not of the common and
vulgar, or the mighty and proud—but of the venerated,
the saint by the decree of public judgment,
whether misguided or not. There it stands in the
form of ancient days, with its shady olive or locust
grove—the only green spot that greets the eye, with
its well or fountain for the thirsty to drink, where the
weary may repose, or the devout may pray—here are
safety for the wayfarer and sanctuary for the guilty.</p>

<p>And meaner sepultures have not lost their all.
Tread not where the dead repose; it is holy ground!
not consecrated for their use, but hallowed by their
presence: there the sorrowing festival is kept, there
are gathered the mourners with the revolving sun;
there the feast of the dead is prepared and left
for the stranger to partake, and bless the memory
of the departed. Is not this a record of ancient
days?</p>

<p>I cannot dismiss the subject without pointing to
the strange contrast, in merely worldly sense or wisdom,
between the careful attention, which marks all
antiquity, to render the dead innocuous to the living,
and our negligence in this respect. This negligence
has cost more lives and suffering than probably all
the swords of all the conquerors. Epidemics, endemics,
slow fever or rapid plague, ever present in deep
vengeance or savage fury, are the produce of our
enlightened contempt for superstitions, and mark the
imbecility of that intellectual presumption which
blights in our hands the fruits of science, the impulses
of benevolence, and the benefits of freedom. There was
no plague in ancient Egypt, thickly peopled as it was—they
embalmed their dead; elsewhere, when numbers
rendered such precaution advisable, they were
burned. But, where neither embalming nor burning
was practised, they took care at once to remove the
dead from the dwellings of the living, in apprehension
of the evil consequences, and through respect
for the repose of the departed. The scenes that may
daily be witnessed in the metropolis of England, it
would have been impossible for an ancient to have
conceived, save as existing among some race of hitherto
undiscovered savages destitute of the common instincts
of nature.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_223"></a><a href="#footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>We are now striving to remedy this evil by legislative
means. It may not be cared about, but its
enormity no one will dispute, and it fills with astonishment
and disgust those who are induced to examine
into it. But here, as in so many other instances,
the work is done and the evil prevented by some
simple and ancient habits, which are entered in the
traveller’s note-book as at best interesting curiosities,
or amiable weaknesses.</p>

<p>The superstition of the Mussulman lies, however,
the other way, and hence the plague that ravages at
present most other Mussulman countries, and which
we shall see again in Europe—or rather in England—unless
the condition of our London cemeteries be
ameliorated. They do not, indeed, bury in the
towns; but, in making the grave, they leave a hollow
space above the body, in the belief that it has to sit
up finally, to surrender the soul to the angel of death.
Boards are then placed two feet above the body, and
over this but a slight covering of earth. Thus the
gases from the decomposing flesh are collected, and
escape; and being heavier than the atmospheric air,
flow around, seeking the lowest level, and pour downwards,
so that when the cemetery is above the dwellings,
these are periodically subject to the plague.
I have observed this so constantly, so regularly, that,
on merely glancing at the position of a town, I can
tell whether it is or is not subject to the plague,
in what quarters it is so subject, and, judging by
the winds that prevail, at what season. I do not
speak of those vapours as immediately and necessarily
producing the plague, but as favouring its
extension. Our typhus, a low plague, is never wanting
in cities peculiarly exposed to the vapours from
overstocked grave-yards. In fact, as decomposed
vegetable matter gives us intermittent fevers, so does
decomposed animal matter furnish, according to the
climate and atmosphere, putrid fever, typhus, yellow
fever, and plague.</p>

<h4 class="h4head"><span class="allsmcap">SHEMISH, THE GARDENS OF THE HESPERIDES.</span></h4>

<p class="p2">We very soon came upon another lake which has
no regular opening to the sea, though the bank of
sand is occasionally moved. It must have been
here that Don Sebastian projected making the entrance
for his internal harbour; but the lake with
which this entrance communicates is of small extent,
apparently of no great depth, and separated
from the long lake by a neck of land of no great
elevation, but which from its sandy nature it would
be a great enterprise to cut through. We passed
over a good deal of flat ground, like Hungary, completely
under cultivation, and the fields perfectly
clean: the douars had the look of villages, and we
could scarcely believe that there were not built
houses amongst them.</p>

<p>Towards evening we came upon a country of a
new aspect—broken ground, aluminous shale, covered
with a straggling oak forest. Herds of cattle were
pointed out to us, which were said to be turned out
there to multiply without the care of man; and we
came upon a douar in the midst of this forest, where
I was very much tempted to bivouac for the night.
It was like a scene in one of the wooded vales of
Western Greece: however, we pushed on for Larache,
the gardens of which we entered long after
it was pitch-dark. The road between them was
sand: there was no possibility of getting water
either by fountain, stream, or well—such is the site
of the Gardens of the Hesperides! I had to postpone
the satisfaction of my curiosity till the morrow’s
light, and entered the capital of the King
of the Giants with that sort of reverence and awe
which I had felt in approaching the ruins of Stonehenge.</p>

<p>We were led through a labyrinth of strange and
precipitous streets, till we came down to the lower
wall on the side of the harbour: the houses looked
like the little tombs at Pompeii by the wayside.
We were received by the English Consular Agent,
a Genoese, whom, notwithstanding his European habiliments,
we might have taken for a Moor by his
quiet demeanour, and his unobtrusive attention to
all our wants. A scene rose next morning such as
deserved to shine on the groves of the Danaïdes.
Before one sweeps with many a bend the stream,
on whose tranquil breast reposes the wreck of the
navy of Morocco—a corvette, two brigs, and a schooner.
A high bank of sand shuts out the sea, save at the
narrow bar. In front of the town a verdant plain
is spread; all round it flows the river, and beyond
it rises an amphitheatre of broken hills of a lively
mountain aspect, and with other forms and other
colours than those of the Zahel. Over these were
scattered gardens; but the gardens of Morocco, which,
unlike those of any other land, are embellished by the
bank of cactus, that serves them for a wall, and
painted with the leaden green of the aloe.</p>

<p>To the east, and opposite the sea entrance, there
is a detached hill, like that upon which are situated
the ruins of Epidaurus, a spot which must be ever
green in the memory of travellers in Greece. Considering
this to be a last chance of finding a Phœnician
city, I commenced inquiries, and was told that the
hill was covered with ruins which had been deserted
from the memory of man, and that the hill was called
<span class="place">Shemish</span>. I at once determined to delay my journey
in order to devise means to visit it. This was no
easy matter, and I thought the best plan was to
try and get into a boat without my guards, and
then trust to chance and perseverance for being able
to push on.</p>

<p>Having no suspicion, they allowed me to get into a
boat, accompanied by a soldier of the town. We
embarked at a jetty, close to which lay in tier in
a strong tide-way, four tolerably-sized European
vessels, laden with corn, bark and wool, waiting for
an opportunity of getting over the bar. We kept
close to the bank of sand thrown up by the sea,
behind which lay the dismantled and perishing
vessels I have already mentioned. The water was
much discoloured; and, like that of the Seboo, bore
traces of chalk. I observed something white on the
bank: pulling to the spot, I found it really to be
chalk, an outlyer standing on its edge. It was harder
than the common chalk of England. The flints were
large masses, and there was a coating on them of
crystals of carbonate of lime. The masses of flints
were evidently the same as those which had become
gasule. Close by there was a hill like an artificial
mound, and on it the regular sheep-walks of our
chalk ranges. Under it we landed, as it adjoined
Shemish and was connected with it by a low neck.
The rocky eminence of Shemish is sandstone, not that
which encrusts the Zahel, but a compact and ancient
rock, and sometimes approaching to granular quartz.</p>

<p>From the top of Shemish the prospect is striking,
from the extraordinary windings of the river to the
south and east: it turns back upon itself, more like
the windings of a serpent than the meanderings of a
stream. Hence it derives its name of <span class="place">Elcos</span>, or the
boa; hence, too, the fable of the dragon. There was
no fable in the guardianship. The protection was
not in his folds, but in his foaming head—the bar
that closed the entrance.</p>

<p>In Pliny’s time the little plain was only partially
formed. “At thirty-two thousand paces from this place
(Tangier) is Lixos, of which the ancients relate so many
fables, and which was made a colony by the cruelty of
Claudius Cæsar. There was the kingdom of Anteus;
there his strife with Hercules; there the gardens of
the Hesperides. An estuary, with a meandering
course, communicates with the sea, over which the
dragon is said to have kept watch: an island is embraced
within the curves of the water, which, though
but slightly raised above the surrounding land, is
never covered by the tide. There is a temple to Hercules,
and some wild olives that are found there are all
that remain of its groves, said to bear golden fruit.”</p>

<p>He then proceeds to speak of the “portentosa
mendacia” of the Greeks in respect to this site; and
it reminded me of the “quicquid Græcia mendax
audet in historia” of Juvenal, speaking of the canal of
Xerxes, which, disbelieved by the Roman satirist, may
be seen and traced at this hour. So, in like manner,
the golden fruit of Lixos blossoms and ripens to this
day, despite the incredulity of the Roman naturalist.</p>

<p>These ruins have not been hitherto described; they
will soon be demolished. Walls which, I was told,
had been some years ago continuous, and much
higher than at present, surround the crest of an irregular
hill: the circuit may be three miles. Where
I first came upon them I found walls in tapia and
mortar, and stones, having entirely the Moorish
character. I began to apprehend the repetition of the
disappointment I had so often experienced.</p>

<p>The rolled fragments of stone and lime would not
alone do. I wanted some chiselling, and something to
resemble the bulwarks which Nonnus tells us Cadmus
(<i>i. e.</i> the Phœnician) gave to the hundred cities he
planted in this <span class="lock">border:—-</span></p>

<p class="unindent">And I did come on evidences indisputable. These
were hewn stone, neither Roman, Hellenic, nor Cyclopic.
They were large, not in regular tiers, nor
polygonal, and joined with cement. One stone which
I measured was ten feet by three. The angles were
thus constructed. The walls were in rude work of
stone and lime, which, but for the connexion in
which I found them, might have passed for recent.
They exactly resemble the ruins which are called
“Old Tangier.”</p>

<p>I now at length did see a Phœnician wall, and
knew what it was. On the summit of the hill a more
ancient building seems to have been converted into a
magazine:<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_224"></a><a href="#footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></span>
it is roofed in and terraced over. Near
it there is the circular end of a building, standing
about twenty feet in height and thirty in diameter.
There were long, vaulted chambers, in pairs, like
congreve locks, arched and double, twenty feet long,
six feet wide, and twelve feet high. They were
scattered all over the place, within the walls and
without. I went into nine or ten of them. There was
no mark of water on the sides. I hardly think they
could have been cisterns. I could not imagine to
what use they were
destined.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_225"></a><a href="#footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a></span>
This was all I could
make out by scrambling through the thick brushwood
for the greater portion of the day.</p>

<p>The emblem of peace is busily engaged in upturning
these precious remains. The branches of the wild
olive are rounded like the oak, and do not, like those
of the grafted tree, adjust themselves to the form of
the buildings in which they have struck root, as in the
ruins of Greece and Italy. They are here thickly
planted, and their roots and branches are so many
wedges driven into the walls. I observed a stone,
which could not be under ten tons, lifted up from
the top of a wall, between the branches of a tree,
which again was yielding under its weight. It
reminded me of the admired, but false, metaphor of
Lamartine, when he compares the heart, early love-stricken,
to a tree that bears aloft the hatchet-head,
which had been buried in its stem.</p>

<p>The rock was covered with a variety of plants, which
would have presented a rich harvest to a botanist:
I can notice but some belonging to the times of old.
Hesperus, fresh leaping from the ocean, here found in
every season all flowers for his wreath; the lotus, the
myrtle, and the palm; the pine, the arar, which represents
the cypress. The acanthus covered the ground
with its deep green, glossy, and spreading leaves. The
ivy, instead of crawling over stones or trunks, spreads
over the boughs of trees, and hangs in festoons
between them, with a thin cord-like stem, and delicate
leaves studding it upon either side. The berries are
in clusters, like diminutive bunches of grapes, and the
image of the vine is completed by spiral tendrils. I
now saw why it was that the ivy had been appropriated
to Bacchus; it was the image of the vine
fitted for a crown. I took one of its long shoots, and
wreathed it into a chaplet, and placed it on the head
of one of the wine-denying Moors, a boatman who
had accompanied me, and he was no less delighted at
the implied courtesy than I at the real beauty of the
object.</p>

<p>Perhaps, however, the connexion of the ivy and
Bacchus may be no more than a pun. To him were
consecrated a plant and a bird, and both had the
same name, <ins title="kissa" lang="el">κίσσα</ins> and <ins title="kissos" lang="el">κίσσος</ins>,
the magpie and the ivy.
Bochart makes out the proper name of Bacchus to
have been nearly the same, and himself the chief of
the first of the wine-growing countries, the founder
of an empire which conquered India, and which has
left behind monuments to substantiate any fable which
Greek fancy could create. In fact, Bacchus is no
other than Chus, or <i>Bar Chusii</i>, whom we call Nimrod,
and the Greeks Nebrodes, being a great hunter, and
therefore painted with the skins of wild animals—chiefly
the tiger, or <dfn>nimra</dfn>—the spoils of which cover
the shoulders of Bacchus, while the captive animal is
yoked to his car.</p>

<p>The crown for the festivities of Apollo, I now saw
was neither our laurel nor the bay, the branches of
which never could have been used for such a purpose,
as any gem or statue will show. At Shemish a plant
luxuriates which possesses all the qualities requisite
for this ornament. It is a bush, standing four or five
feet high, which sends up yearly twigs, round, smooth,
green, and pliant. The leaves are set along it alternately,
and these are soft, glossy, delicate in texture
and elegant in form, and yet of extraordinary durability;
and the twigs are just the length required for
a chaplet: a red berry hangs to the leaf by a fine
thread, while simultaneously it bears the flower, which
is a small star of six fleshy points, of the palest green,
with an amethyst cup in the
centre.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_226"></a><a href="#footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>The tree of Minerva, in all its stubborn and unsubjugated
vigour, here flourishes in scorn on Neptune’s
border, and the oak of Jupiter, presenting food for
man, completes the assemblage of these leafy reminiscences
of time gone by, veiling the grey ruins that
the elements had not yet destroyed, nor man laid low.
Here were the things of Nature, which they in their
time admired, leaf for leaf, and line for line; bright,
gay, verdant, with their shining dewdrops, and their
buzzing insects; and there, after thirty centuries, lay
the stones they had chiselled, and the mortar they
had mixed. The air of such a place breathes of
nepenthes,—the poppy of memory, not forgetfulness.
It is covered with a mirage of recollections, on which
the spirit floats, and with which it mingles. Its
solitude invited the busy throng of other times.
There was the work of their hands, the place of their
choice, the field of their labour, the haven of their
traffic. There the horizon they looked upon; the
plants they gathered, the trees they cultivated, the
sun that awoke the wind that refreshed them. I saw
them in the choice they had made, and lived amongst
them, in seeing what they saw, and feeling as they
felt. As an angel that has conversed with man, they
have taken their flight—they have disappeared, as if,
like the sun, to visit other climes. Their western-bound
prows, perchance, followed his course, flying from
the Chaldean or the Macedonian; their last glances
may have rested on this height, where I first beheld
walls which their hands had reared. Or this might
have been the end of their pilgrimage. They were
beyond the reach of the conqueror and Libya, which
had offered an asylum to the fugitives of Jericho, and
Moab might have yielded one also to those of Tyre.</p>

<p>I had been astonished at finding no fragment
whatever of marble. I cannot say but that this
raised some doubt in my mind; but on getting down
to the bank of the river, to the southward, I came
upon <em>nine lime-kilns</em>. There was a little commerce
established, a landing-place for the boats, and large
sugar-casks for the lime. They have now exhausted
the quarry. The quantity extracted must have been
immense, for they have been at work for two years.
The contents of one kiln had been drawn out, and
they were about to slake them. I pulled out entire
one morsel, which resembled the front part of the Egyptian
Pshent.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_227"></a><a href="#footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></span>
The lime is used for a new palace of
the Caïd, for government stores, and the repairs of
the batteries, suggested by the French bombardment.</p>

<p>Thus have been disposed of relics that might have
thrown light on the early history of this portion of
the world, and supplied in some degree the loss of
the libraries of Carthage and Alexandria. To add to
the provocation, close by they had an inexhaustible
store of material, more easily calcinable, had they but
known. I have been informed, however, that it was
with the purpose of destroying an object of interest
to Europeans that the order was sent. If so, this is
one of the effects of the <i lang="fr">journée</i> or <i lang="fr">déjeûner</i> of Isly.</p>

<p><span lang="la">“Sit ne aliqua super spes,”</span> exclaims Eckhel, <span lang="la">“fore
ut plus lucis his Phœniciorum reliquiis adfundatur?
Aio superesse exiguam nisi ex terræ sinu proferantur
monumenta copiosiora.”</span> How many, alas! since he
wrote have been plastered into walls. Strange fate,
that of these explorers of the land and sea—these
instructors in all art and science—every trace should
have disappeared! There remains no shred of their
tissues, no tint of their dyes, no limb of their statues,
no corner of their palaces, no stone of their temples:
no annalist has noted for us their facts; no epic
has been built up from their story; no Sophocles
replaced their heroes on a mimic stage; no Pindar
prolonged the echo of their chariot wheels.</p>

<p>But though until I visited this place I did not
know even where to go to look for a wall of this
construction, from the scanty fragments that have
been gleaned we learn, that all that Greece and Rome
could boast are nothing more than monuments of <em>their</em>
greatness,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_228"></a><a href="#footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></span>
and of a greatness in which they have no
compeers. All other dominations have extinguished
what it overshadowed, and devoured what it covered.</p>

<p>Is not this the interpretation of the fable of the
Phœnix?—a bird perishing in fire; a new life springing
from its ashes. It was not the procreation of the
breed; it was not the colonies that had gone forth
from its loins. The parentage was spiritual, and the
type revived in new matter. There was but one
Phœnix. There has been but one Phœnicia, and all
that we have of light and letters to this day has
come from her. Her name, that of a bird, and a tree—the
palm of Judæa, and the wings of her sea-faring
sons.</p>

<p>It occurred to me that Larache, as the city of
Antæus and the giants, must have been that belonging
to the original population, and Shemish the
Phœnician settlement. This would explain that remarkable
expression, “Libo-Phœnician cities.” It
was not Phœnician or Carthaginian territory: it was
their <em>cities</em>. It was not their cities among an uncultivated
people; the Libyans had cities too. The
cities of both were linked together, and here they
were. Nor is it at this place alone. At Tangier it
is precisely the same: the old city, which now I
know to be Phœnician, is on the opposite side of
the bay. At Arzela there are ruins of the same
kind across the river; at Dar el Baida they are on
the neighbouring headland. The still existing cities
I, of course, take to be the original ones. They are
in couples: in none of these cases could the one
have supplanted the other. They owe their conjoint
existence to the peculiar nature of the Phœnician
settlements: they lived together, each requiring his
own establishment, but neither encroaching on or
displacing the other.</p>

<p>Carthage, in the height of her power, paid ground-rent.
It was not till the latter time, and in her
struggles with Rome, that she sought to govern and
possess, according to our present notions; and it
was in Sicily and Spain that she set her hands to
this craft, and brought down her own ruin.</p>

<p>The greatness of Carthage was founded on the
confidence that the native population had in her
integrity. <i lang="la">Punica fides</i> could not have been turned
to a reproach, had it not at first represented a truth.
Had she, like the English or the French, the Spaniards
or the Portuguese, been even suspected of being a
grasping power, she must either have become mistress
of Mauritania, or been expelled from its border, or
shut up in useless rocks upon its coast; and the
word “Libo-Phœnician cities” would never have
descended to our time.</p>

<p>We are without any direct and positive information
respecting the internal management, or the external
relations of those cities, or their ties with the
parent state; but a city, in every respect similarly
situated, has been described by ancient authors, in
a sufficiently distinct manner to put what I have
said on more secure grounds than that of mere reference.
The city I refer to is Emporiæ, one of the
great settlements of Spain; the only one, then, not
Phœnician, but founded by that branch of the Ionic
Greeks which drew nearest to them in character and
enterprise, and with whom alone of the Greeks they
had made friendship on the field of
battle.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_229"></a><a href="#footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></span> It was
the counterpart in Iberia of Marseilles in Gaul, and
completed the range of Phocæan traffic. It was
exactly what the Libo-Phœnician cities were, as its
name alone suffices to show; for Emporion is not,
as is supposed, a Greek, but a Phœnician word, and
all these cities had the generic name of Emporiæ,
having their proper name besides.</p>

<p>Like Tyre, Emporiæ was originally on an island:
on being abandoned, it was called in like manner
<span class="place">Palæopolis</span>. The colonists then joined with the Hispani
in the same town, which seems to have been
called Indica; the tribe was called Indigetes. They
were received as guests, and allowed to join their
city to that of the Hispani:<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_230"></a><a href="#footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></span>
it was thence called
<span class="place">Dispolis</span>. The part belonging to the Greeks looked
to the sea, the other to the land: the first was four
hundred paces in circuit, the second three thousand.
Each people preserved its laws and customs. Intercourse,
except for purposes of commerce, was forbidden;
and thence, according to Livy, no dispute ever
arose to interrupt the harmony of their neighbourhood
during the ages of this common habitation. So unwearied
was the watchfulness of the Greeks, that one-third
of the male population nightly mounted guard.</p>

<p>This vigilance—the striking contrast between those
really living communities and our heaps of sand—was
not peculiar to the Phocæans; nor was the disposition
to grant sites for cities, and the privileges of
self-government to settlers, peculiar to the Indigetes.
Here is a picture of the times; and, with such
modifications as circumstances cast over the delineation,
we see all the other Emporia on the coasts of
Libya or Iberia.</p>

<p>I have said that Emporion was not a Greek word.
The Chaldæan paraphrase (Genesis <abbr title="25">xxv.</abbr> 3) has <dfn>Emporius</dfn>
for merchants, <dfn>Emporioth</dfn> for merchandise.
Leptis is mentioned, both as one of the Emporia and
one of the Lybo-Phœnician
cities.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_231"></a><a href="#footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></span> Livy says that
Scipio spent his time between the “<i lang="la">Punica</i> Emporia
gentemque Garamantum.” He went now to visit the
natives, now the commercial establishments, which,
instead of bolts, had fortresses for their defence.</p>

<p>Scylax couples the cities and Emporia. “The
Carthaginians,” says he, “spread from the Syrtes to
the Columns of Hercules.” The words are singular,
and seem to mark a difficulty of expression, such as
occurs when describing habits so foreign: cities along
a coast, forming a nation and government apart—an
empire, as it were, standing on
points.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_232"></a><a href="#footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>But so far from
the <ins title="polismata" lang="el">πολίσματα</ins><span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_233"></a><a href="#footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></span>
and the Emporia
subjugating the native population centuries afterwards,
and when the Roman sword had been thrown into
the scale with the Tyrian trinkets, it was not the
city that overspread the plain with its shadow, but
the people of the wilderness that had assimilated
to themselves the urban system, defying alike the
imperial power and the metropolitan civilization.</p>

<p>Severus, on attaining the imperial purple, sent for
his sister from <span class="place">Leptis</span>, and was much ashamed of her
that she could scarcely speak
Latin.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_234"></a><a href="#footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></span> Was it, then,
Phœnician she spoke?—not at all. Sallust has told
us, in his time, that the language was changed by
<em>intermarriages with the
Numidians</em>.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_235"></a><a href="#footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>Was it a disadvantage to Rome that there was
no uniformity? Had Rome been possessed with the
mania of uniformity, she could at best have remained
only a small state on the Tiber.</p>

<p>The Carthaginians kept their cities distinct from
the cities of the Lybians: the Romans kept their
laws distinct from the customs of the country. Rome
could even <em>unite</em> provinces, strange as it may seem
with our experience, without convulsing them or
throwing them into rebellion, for the union was
judicial, not administrative or legislative. This reserve,
which was the secret of the power of Carthage,
became the source of the prosperity and tranquillity
of Roman Mauritania, amidst the convulsions of the
rest of the empire down to the invasion of the barbarians,
which—in Africa at least—were uninvited
by the provincials.</p>

<p class="p2 center allsmcap">THE HESPERIDES.</p>

<p>A garden is not hot-houses to force fruits, or conservatories
to preserve flowers: it is forest and fountain,
affording shade and water; to these you may
<em>add</em> flowers and fruits. An Eastern goes to his garden
to enjoy nature, not to study
art<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_236"></a><a href="#footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a></span>—goes to it for
shelter in the sultry hours, or to regale himself in the
even-tide. Thus says Solomon:—“A garden enclosed
is my sister, a spring shut up, a fountain sealed. I
am come into my garden, I have eaten my honeycomb,
and have drunk my wine and my milk.”</p>

<p>The world began with a garden. Of the first one,
it is said, “the Lord planted it.” The botanist, who
considered that the greatest compliment ever paid
to his science was, when Christ said, “Consider the
lilies of the field,” must have forgotten the workmanship
of the first of orchards, for it was trees
which constituted that garden. “Every tree that
is pleasant to the sight or good for food,” and immediately
after there are the rivers enumerated that
spring in it. The garden was the first special work
of Providence: it was the habitation appointed for
our undefiled nature. Its culture was the first task
allotted to man,—and it is sometimes the last, when
all that life can yield or fortune bestow has been tried
and exhausted. Tamerlane, when he had conquered
the world, turned gardener at Samarkand.</p>

<p>They can fit up any place into a garden. I have
spent an evening amongst a bed of leeks, which had
suddenly assumed all the pretensions of a parterre
and kiosk; a few plants to lay the cushions and
carpets on, a couple of glass balls for the lights, a
little tin wheel, on which a jet of water was conducted,
some jessamine plants detached from a wall
to form a canopy over our heads, the leeks pulled up
in front to open a way for the supper. This kind
of garden is a sort of out-of-door existence, and essentially
belonging to a people with tents, and has its
conveniences and luxuries adapted for transport.</p>

<p>There is no botany, no horticulture; their taste
is ignorant. Their love of flowers is not as they are
arranged in classes, multiplied in leaves, or varied in
colours—it is for themselves—their natural forms,
their pure colours, and their sweet odours. It is unobtrusive
and silent, or vocal only as in the verses of
Solomon and the songs of the Troubadours. “A man
may be a good botanist,” said Rousseau, “although
he does not know the name of a single plant.”</p>

<p>The Easterns do not like to come empty-handed,
and the commonest, as the fairest, flowers suffice.
But it is not a <em>nosegay</em> or a <em>bouquet</em>, but a <em>flower</em>
that they present. The leaf and stem are to them
just as beautiful as the blossom; and a bundle of
heads of flowers would appear to them much like
a heap of human heads. In the numerous Chinese
figures and ornaments that encumber our tables and
rooms, it may be observed that, wherever there are
flowers, they are single, each by itself in a vase. A
piece of pottery has recently been brought to England
from the Greek Islands: it is unique, and no description
has been discovered of its uses. It is a
vase about four inches in diameter, surrounded with
two circles of very small vases, which stand out from
it: it is evidently for flowers, and so placed that
each should have its own stalk and vessel. The Moors
also have a flower-dish for the room: the top in
pierced pottery, so that each stands by itself. One
of the things which in Europe have shamed me most
in the presence of an Eastern is the bouquet, or painted
cauliflower head, in the hand of a lady. Alas! that
perversion of taste should always fasten on her fairest
subjects!</p>

<p>Their weeds, stunted in our hot-houses, are their
chief embellishments; the cactus, for instance, and
the aloe. Here the one bears flowers like a standard,
and the other fruit like a flower. Without science,
numbers of plants, or skill in rearing and combining delicate
and diverse natures, a garden rises to something
infinitely beyond our ideas, whether of use or grandeur.
So may it be traced on the Nile in the palmy
days of the Pharaohs, on the Xenil in those of the
Abderachmans, no less than at Jerusalem and Babylon.</p>

<p>The Hanging Gardens were the least like what a
European would expect: the authenticity of the concurrent
testimony of Diodorus Siculus, Quintus Curtius,
and Josephus has consequently been questioned.
There was no assortment like Kew—no show like
Chiswick. Flowers are no more mentioned than
cabbages or carrots.</p>

<p>The land was intersected with canals, carrying
water field by field over the Doab of the Tigris and
Euphrates; beyond this region spread dead levels,
which, as Xenophon says, resembled the sea. From
the city’s lofty walls stretched on all sides, far as eye
could reach, flatness and luxuriance. What, then,
could taste divine and power accomplish—if not the rivalling
of wild nature—to transport thither a primeval
forest, and to pile up coctile mountains to place it on.
Such was the design of the Hanging Gardens; and,
when accomplished, doubtless they were a wonder.</p>

<p>The forest-crowned battlements of Lucca, diminutive
as they are, and in the midst of wood and
mountains, nevertheless please the eye. A palm-tree
on one of the towers of Arta often recurs to my
memory as one of the most attractive and picturesque
features of that lovely region. The sculptures of
Nineveh present the same thing: on the towers of
cities are planted palm and other trees, confirming
the accounts of the Hanging Gardens. They afford,
no doubt, protection; for, if not useful in time of war,
they would have been cut
down.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_237"></a><a href="#footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></span>
The walls of these
ancient cities were broad enough to bear a forest band,
and might have had a stream or river running along
for their nourishment.</p>

<p>In the gardens of
Azarah<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_238"></a><a href="#footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></span> we have the same theme
in a different mode. Around were mountains; these
were all planted with fruit-trees and cultivated with
flowers. The palace, as it were, walked forth into
the garden, and its glory consisted in Mosaic walks,
fountains, kiosks; and there, of course, in their excellence
were to be seen those peculiarities of gardening
we can still trace in Morocco and in Spain and
Portugal, which I have already mentioned in describing
Kitan and Ceuta, and which those who visit the
Peninsula get some idea of by the fortress of Lisbon,
and especially by the courts of the convent of Bellem,
and—though travestied—in the Alcazar at Seville.</p>

<p>We know more of the domestic manners of the
Egyptians than of those of any people who have
preceded us; and I should imagine that the pictured
walls of the Memnons furnish the best delineation,
however unsuccessful the Egyptians were in painting
flowers, of what those gardens
were<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_239"></a><a href="#footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></span> which the
Saracens constructed in Spain, and how they arranged
and assorted together verdure and architecture, flowers,
trees, land, and water. In the Middle Ages, nothing
more excited the wonder of Europe than the gardens
of Andalusia; and that that exquisite gardening is of
the highest antiquity is clear, from “heaven” in all
languages being called
“paradise.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_240"></a><a href="#footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>The Hesperides, the seats of the blessed, were
orchards.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_241"></a><a href="#footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a></span>
A garden being the abode of the dead,
a tree came to be the symbol of death in that of
life. On the sepulchral monuments, the tree of the
Hesperides and the strigil are the most constant
emblems—the one representing immortality, the other
purity. At Nineveh, the tree of life is associated
with the living, not the dead. As the sun set in the
west, and as the west was considered to be the place
to which the spirits repaired, their abode, Hezperi,
came to mean the evening, or Hesperus. The site
of the Hesperides can admit, therefore, of no doubt
or ambiguity; and the name given to another part
of Africa in the neighbourhood of Carthage can only
be understood as figuratively expressing its excellences
and beauty.</p>

<p>Their gardens may still be described as copses of
fruit-trees, as is naturally to be expected in the
country of the orange, lemon, and citron, when flower,
foliage, verdure, shade, and fruit were all combined—not
evanescent in an hour, or exchanging their
merits, but combined in one, and enduring nearly
throughout the year. The orange, in a hot country,
is the very excellence of fruit; and, if we were not
familiarised with its form and flavour, the aspect of
a Moorish garden of that description would prompt all
that the same sight prompted to the Greeks of old.</p>

<p>A peculiarity of their gardening is, that they do
not mix the different kinds. The Jews were forbidden
to mix the olive and the vine; and Solomon
speaks of a garden of nuts (it should be almonds).
This is the fashion here: the garden is a square—it
is again laid out in squares, in the way that we
dispose a farm for rotation crops. Thus, the gardens
of the Sultan at Morocco are divided off into almonds,
pomegranates, figs, pears, cherries. The square divisions
are separated by alleys of the dimensions of
streets, but some greater than others. Columns run
along; and above these, and partly down the sides,
there is a fret-work of bamboo; over these are trained
vines, the clusters depending through the trellis (as
seen in the Egyptian tombs). Jessamine (the large
white and yellow flower) and other plants are trained
up the columns, and festooned around them. Through
these alleys you ride on horseback; and at the intersections
there are vast halls, like that I have described
at Kitan, of bamboo fret-work: the portals
and openings imitate windows, and are twined and
matted with various creepers.</p>

<p>On both sides of the alleys flow the rivulets for
irrigation; and, there being no weeds or under-verdure,
you have the refreshing coolness without the
effects of rank vegetation. The style of the private
gardens is the same.</p>

<p>Oranges and lemons are, however, classed by themselves.
They are planted together, and in certain
proportions, viz. the orange sweet and bitter, the
lemon sweet and bitter, the citron large and small—in
all, nearly a dozen varieties. A garden of this kind
is called <dfn>quorce</dfn>. The common orange has evidently
been a graft from the East, for it is called <dfn>chin</dfn>: in
<dfn>lim</dfn> and <dfn>rungh</dfn> may be found the root of our lemon
and orange. To the eastward, the Arabs call the
orange <dfn>Berdkou</dfn>. <dfn>Portugal</dfn> is so called by the
Greeks, &amp;c.; and probably that general name which
it has acquired in the Levant comes from the Portuguese
traffic when they were in possession of the
ports of Barbary.</p>

<p>So recent is the introduction of these plants in
the East, that I have been shown the stumps of the
two trees first planted in the island now most celebrated
for their growth, and where the gardens resemble
those of Barbary, having the three varieties
mixed together. This island is Naxos: the two trees
are called Adam and Eve, and they say they were
brought by the Venetians. That, of course, is a
mistake, but it shows that they came from the West.</p>

<p>Throughout the country the trees are generally
evergreens—the olive, wild and cultivated, the cork,
oak, the arar, the locust, the palm, the palmetto, the
orange and lemon, the lotus and myrtle, and, finally,
the Barbary fig and aloe, which give to the land its
tropical and ideal character. The whole country is
covered with what are our garden flowers; so that
now, in the depth of winter, there is no sign of the
hoary monarch save in the gardens, where the fruit-trees
are naked; but these leafless copses did not
suffice, under a glowing sun and with a verdant landscape,
to cool, even in thought, the summer breath into
a winter chill. They merely looked like withered trees,
and the gardens were the only spots that did not smile.
I speak of those that were scattered along our road,
not of the septs of pale blue fantastic vegetation
enclosing the dark shining groves of <dfn>quorce</dfn> (orange
and lemon) that grace the banks of the Lixus.</p>

<p>It is not without reason that the cactus is called
the Barbary fig. It grows so abundantly and luxuriantly,
and is so well adapted to the soil and climate;
flourishing in the arid sand, covering it with a grateful
shade, fertilizing it with its thick succulent
branches as they fall, fostering other plants by its
shelter, and furnishing in abundance a healthy and
refreshing crop of fruit, which fringes or studs its
gigantic leaves.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_242"></a><a href="#footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></span>
The fig has a thick rind, which is
pared off: this, in Spain, is treasured up for the pigs.
Like the Turkey, the prickly pear, though cherished,
is repudiated, every people calling it by the name
of some other people: we call it Barbary fig, the
Moors call it Christian fig—<dfn>kermus ensare</dfn>. The
Spaniards call it <dfn>Tuna</dfn>, as having been imported from
Tunis; the Shillohs of Sus call it <dfn>Tacanarete</dfn>, as if
it had come to them from the Canary Islands. There
is but one people who have boldly adopted it, and
that is the Mexicans, who have taken it as their
national emblem, and have associated it upon their
coins with the shashea, or Barbary cap, intended to
represent Liberty. It is doubtless from the word
“karmus” that we have taken
“kermes,”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_243"></a><a href="#footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a></span> the name
of the insect growing upon it, and one variety of
which furnishes the cochineal. The people of the
Canary Islands call it
“alcormas,”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_244"></a><a href="#footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></span>
which, in fact, is
the kermus, the common term of the Arabs for fig.
This, I think, suffices to vindicate the claims of Barbary
to its prickly pear; for the people of the Canaries
were driven from Africa at a remote period, and were
of the race of the Shillohs, as their language, names,
and customs, noted at the time of their discovery
and conquest, can leave no doubt.</p>

<p>The aloe bears no fruit: the stalk of the blossom
serves for the purposes of light timber. It blossoms
about the seventh year, and then dies: it rises from
the seed that falls. They are not acquainted with
the liquor, like soured milk (yourt), which the Mexicans
draw from it (pulke) by tapping. The Moors
do not convert its fibres into the same beautiful work
as the Mexicans, or the inhabitants of the Eastern
Archipelago, but they use them for sewing. An Arab
woman, when she has needlework, goes into the garden
to gather her thread: the thread, like the plant, is
called “gorsean.” I have been told that some of the
very old lace made by the Jews is of this fibre.</p>

<p>The kitchen-gardens surround every town like a
suburb, and in them we have, no doubt, the “gardens
of herbs” of the Jews. The distribution of land for
a town under the Jewish system required a space
sufficient for a garden for each household; and,
beyond the ground so appropriated, there was the
common land or pasturages. The same rule prevails
here; and there is a common shepherd and cowherd
who comes for the cattle in the morning and brings
them home at night. The gardens are small squares,
divided off internally with rows of tall reeds. There
is a plank door with lintels; all the rest of the
enclosure is of growing plants. The soil is generally
sand: here in the gardens above the town, and
through which I passed last night, it is nothing but
sand, and its fertility depends on the shelter afforded it.
The tall reeds fence it round; there is then a path
on the four sides, on the inner side of the path
fruit-trees; and the centre, between the trees and the
path adjoining the reeds, is covered with a trellis,
over which vines are trained. The smaller ones are
without trees; so that, as you peep into them, they
look like large rooms or corridors.</p>

<p>They say that the smell of the cistus cools one: I
fancied I experienced the same effect in looking at
the mirage-like colours of the cactus and aloe. But
what is to be said of their forms?—can anything be
more antithetical than the straight lines and the sharp
points and daggers of the aloe, and the distorted contorted
lobes and projections of the prickly pear?
Mingled together, as they generally are, they keep
the mind occupied with their strangeness and their
contrasts. More than once I have heard Europeans
express themselves angrily about them, and revile
their “monstrosities.” As seen in our hot-houses,
the form may be known, but that is all; no idea
can be formed of the cavern-like alley with which,
when they rise fifteen or twenty feet, they cover the
ground. The aloe is the outer fence, or <i lang="fr">chevaux-de-frise</i>,
the cactus rising higher within: through
these are mingled the tall slender reeds, as if to unite
in one bond the three most dissimilar things in nature.
Together, they form a fence which might delay an
army, and present to the archer Phœbus a testudo
which defies his shafts.</p>

<p>On the coast, the heat is tempered by the sea-breezes
at the hottest times of the year and day;
but the influence of these winds is lost as they pass
inwards, and in three or four miles they become
themselves heated. Along the Zahel their cooling
breath is expended on the barren sand. Here the
sands cease and the rich soil commences. There is
no languid autumn and benumbing winter, no trying
spring or scorching summer, but unceasing verdure
and ever-springing plants.</p>

<p>To the south fertility is wanting; to the north
there are the heavy vapours of the easterly wind.
Sheltered from the blasts of the sea, though inhaling
its health and freshness, and from the damp wind
that sweeps through the Gut of Gibraltar and infects
the shores of Spain and Morocco,—this region enjoys
the richest soil, the most fortunate site in a clime
where barren sand upon a mountain-top can bear the
choicest fruits and the fairest flowers; a clime which
combines the charms of every other, and preserves
throughout the year the luxury of every season.</p>

<p>This climate is adapted to pulmonary invalids.
During the latter days of November, the whole of
December, and the half of January, we have had
but three bad days: there has been but one day
not splendid during our excursion. The want of
trees along the coast—whatever the effect in summer—leaves
in winter no masses of decomposed leaves to
affect the air. The trees, where abundant, are evergreens;
and the vines had not lost their leaves, which
were coloured a deep red. The new figs were formed,
and some of them as large as walnuts; the flowers
were all in blossom; and, though it was cold at
night, it was hot during the day. We have here
the latitude of Madeira, without the exposure to its
storms or sudden changes; nor does the barometer
fluctuate even in storms. It has not fallen below
“change.” I have seen pulmonary diseases, but it has
been in the Jewish quarter, where they live in blocks
of houses with the passage for the air below; sleeping
on the floor, or even below the level of the court,
twenty sometimes in a room, and with barrels of
fermenting raisins in every house, from which they
distil their spirits. Except under such circumstances,
I have observed no trace of affection of the lungs;
and, to all these advantages for a pulmonary patient,
there would be added the bath.</p>

 These gardens have been the occasion of preserving a trait
of Moorish character: an old woman having had a portion of
ground taken from her to complete the enclosure, appealed to
the caïd,—</p>

<p class="footnote">“The magistrate mounted his ass, taking with him a sack of
enormous size, and presented himself before Hisham, who happened
to be then sitting in a pavilion on the very ground belonging
to the old woman. The arrival of the caïd, still more
the sack, which he carried on his shoulders, surprised the
caliph. Ibn Bechir having prostrated himself, entreated the
monarch to allow him to fill his sack with some of the earth on
which they then were. The request was granted, and when the
sack was full, the caïd desired his master to help him to lift it on
his ass. This strange demand astonished Alkakem still more, and
he told the caïd that the load was too heavy. 'O prince,’ replied
Ibn Bechir, 'this sack which you find too heavy, contains but
a very small portion of the earth which you have unjustly taken
from a poor woman; how then at the day of judgment shall you
bear the weight of the whole?’”</p>

<h4 class="h4head"><span class="allsmcap">ARZELA.</span></h4>

<p class="p2">It was evening before we returned to Larache.
The city, which looked so beautiful under the morning
sun, was concealed from us as he set behind it; but
the gardens on the opposite hills received his declining
rays. The ancient cities, which I had visited at these
outlets, are placed on the western side, and therefore
with the evening sun at their back. At Constantinople
it is considered in the rent of a house whether
its view of the Bosphorus is with or against the setting
sun. A garden was pointed out to me which, it was
said, produced the finest oranges in the world: its
produce was reserved for the Sultan. I afterwards
had time to visit the Spanish fortifications from the land
side, which present the peculiar features of that age—sharp
angles, lofty bastions and curtains, massive walls,
and deep moats. I saw some beautiful jars, quite
antique, the manufacture of Casar, ten miles from this.</p>

<p>When I was passing the gate, a Moorish gentleman
accosted me in good English, but with a strong Scotch
accent; he volunteered information about mines, and
promised to visit me in the evening. He came accordingly:
he had been three years in Gibraltar, and
had been on board our fleet during the war. He
began to expatiate on the advantages of European
civilization, and expressed his anxiety to have it introduced
into Barbary. I said to him, that would be
all very well if they could discriminate, but that men
were like Adam in Paradise; that they had to balance
their present state with all its evils against change
with all its chances; that for them change involved
one of two consequences—slavery or pauperism.</p>

<p>He asked me, to my great surprise, for news about
Nadir Bey. This is an adventurer of Russian origin,
who has been going about Europe and Turkey representing
himself as cousin of the Sultan, and claiming
his throne. He had come to Morocco, where he had
succeeded better than elsewhere, obtaining money
and honours, and a firman recognising him as legitimate
sovereign of Turkey! I took occasion from
this incident to show him how perfectly unqualified
they were for dealing in any foreign matter, being
so shamefully hoaxed in such a case as this; upon
which he abruptly jumped up and took his departure.
I thought he had been taken suddenly ill; but I
afterwards learnt that he had been Nadir Bey’s patron,
and had introduced him to the Sultan.</p>

<p>The baggage having been sent across the river in
the evening, next morning at day-break we found
the horses ready laden. The beach-road is practicable
only when the tide is out, and in any case
only for persons well mounted. The tide was not
very favourable, and we were very ill mounted, but
I insisted on going by this road—the sea was
so grand, and I wished to look out for <em>architectural</em>
phenomena. But the bank of sand is here interrupted,
and the cavernous and stalactitic effects were
not to be observed. There were, however, the patterns
of the coloured sands. The river of Larache
brings down the bluest-black iron sand, which indeed
is strewed all along the coast from Meden to Cape
Spartel. The distance to Arzela is only five hours;
but, what with the drag of the sand on the beach,
and getting bogged when we struck into the interior,
and wandering backwards and forwards from the hills
to the beach, and from the beach to the hills, we
made it a long and fatiguing day’s journey.</p>

<p>The country was here as unlike as anything could
be to that which we had passed: it changes suddenly
in appearance and character. At one moment it
would be completely bare, being either cultivated or
fallow, and a few miles on it would be covered, hill
and valley, with brushwood; at one time the palmetto
and ordinary brushwood, and presently a crop of
broom occupying every inch of ground within sight,
covering it with a mantle of brilliant yellow, and
perfuming the air with its sweet odour; then it
would be all as if under snow from the white broom,
that most airy and delicate of shrubs; then would
succeed the gum cistus, with its mingled flowers of
white and red, and its cool refreshing scent.</p>

<p>The odour from the cistus does not lose its savour:
by being exposed to it, it is a gentle refreshing
breeze, of which the nose is conscious, rather than
an odour. The gum from it, the ladanum, is much
esteemed as incense, and is also mixed with mastic
to flavour the breath by chewing it. It is not collected
in this district. The ancient story of its being
scraped from goats’ beards does not seem improbable;
for in breaking through the copses one’s head and
clothes become quite clammy.</p>

<p>The odour is not from the flower, but from the
leaves of the plant: the flowers are of the slightest
texture, but make a lively show, bespangling the
bushes with stars of white or red. They look like
roses, and I was constantly reminded of York and
Lancaster. These flowers live but for a day; and,
constantly tempting the eye and inviting the hand,
the prize is relinquished as soon as reached, and
never was a cistus blossom twined into chaplet or
gathered for a nosegay. Yet, when it clothes the
rocky steep, or mantles the swelling slope, there is
no plant can rival it in the pleasure it gives and
the attention it awakens. It is shrub and flower;
the frailty of its blossoms, the down of its waxy
leaves, the balm of its fragrance, are so unlike the
glancing foliage of other shrubs—the hot-house
forms, the dyer tints, and perfumer scent of other
flowers,—that it makes them look children of art and
care: wild and tender, it is to other flowers as a
shepherdess among women, and to other shrubs as
an Arab among the races of men.</p>

<p>Shrubs with their sturdy life, flowers in their
fleeting passage, serve to embellish the scene, and to
adorn the actors. This one rather shares in our
humanity: as our generations go to the grave and
are renewed again, so it knows vicissitude, and joy,
and mourning. It spreads forth its birth of blossoms
with the early dawn, and strews with the fallen leaves
the earth of eve. Was it from this that the Greeks called
it “flower of the sun;” because, like the rainbow, it
drew its being from his rays? Like the peri, its life
was in a charm, and it died when that charm was gone.</p>

<p>The name “flower of the sun” (<dfn>helio-anthemum</dfn>)
reminds me of the grossest of Flora’s daughters—a
garden Cleon, too gaudy for a vegetable, too meagre
for a shrub, too thick and hard for a flower. And
to this—the very contrast of the cistus—do we
abandon the name selected for it by the Greeks!</p>

<p>There is a variety of the broom which might be
esteemed a garden flower; it is a miniature plant,
eighteen inches or two feet, and—so to speak—one
incrustation of yellow blossom. While underwood is
reduced to the size of a garden-flower, the common
daisy is raised to the pretensions of one, with its
large head on a stalk of twenty inches. All the
plants were our garden tribes, or what would be
wild with us, and were well qualified for a garden—the
broom as I have said, the ivy, then the ranges
of cactus and aloe, hyacinths, jonquils, irises with
the petals coloured green.</p>

<p>About five miles from Arzela, upon a rising ground
close to a douar (here they begin to be stationary),
the palmetto occurred in a new form. It is a bush
two or three feet high, and showing no stem. Here
it rose to ten feet, with snake-like stems carrying
the sharp spicular masses of fans of glossy or glittering
green. I several times made an endeavour to
stop, that I might pass the night in one of the villages,
as I should now call them; not only seduced by the
amenities around, but also partly out of consideration
for our jaded cattle and scarcely less exhausted self:
but guides and guards were inexorable. It was a
settled thing that that night we should sleep at
Arzela; so we pushed or dragged along, as it seemed,
in chace of it, for it never could be in the map
the distance we found it by the road. At last we
descried its lines, tinged by the last reflected light,
against the leaden mass of the Atlantic. We soon
after entered “The Gardens,” and then approached
the castellated gate, where, to our infinite surprise,
an anxious people awaited us.</p>

<p>For several days we had been expected. Rumour
had preceded us, and dealt kindly by us; and we
were gazed at with eager countenances and smiling
eyes, and some of them bright ones. By some process,
strange and capricious, we were no strangers, and
the denizens vied with each other in doing us any
good turn which fell in their way, in expressing their
delight at our arrival, and in welcoming us to their
town. The crowd was hurrying us in a direction which
they had evidently settled in their minds we should
take. I having some voice, as I thought, in the matter,
made bold to ask, “Whither away?” “To Abraham’s!
to Abraham’s!” was shouted. On this I reined
in—I mean, I ceased thrashing; for the memory of
sleepless nights among those conversational Jews, and
some other discomforts which need not be repeated,
and a habit of looking somewhat higher than an
Israelite’s abode, with a disinclination to step down
in the world, came all upon me, and prompted the
emphatic declaration, “We will pitch without the
walls.” No sooner had the words passed my lips
than I could have bitten my tongue off. My eye
had fallen on a countenance of singular amenity, and—although
that of an aged man—of grace: a long
white beard hung down his breast, giving to the
figure the patriarchal cast, which his lineaments vindicated
as legitimately their own by blood as well as
bearing. A cloud passed over his features;—the
impress was so slight that I cannot say I saw, but
I felt it. So recovering, as it were, my sentence,
and inclining to him, I added to the interpreter in
Spanish, “unless we are to go to my father’s house.”</p>

<p>We entered a small court: the floor was red, the
walls were pure white. There was no window. Four
Moorish arches opened to four separate chambers:
two sons with their wives occupied two, his brother
and uncle the third, and himself the fourth. Whether
these were houses or apartments it was not easy to
determine: our words cannot explain. Notwithstanding
many attempts at description, no one who has
not seen these houses has any distinct idea of them.
The same holds with respect to the descriptions left
us of ancient dwellings. The one explains the other:
perhaps, by making them serve mutually for this
purpose, I may be in some degree successful.</p>

<p>This court and hall, for which we have no word,
is the <dfn>patio</dfn> of the Spaniards, the <dfn>woost</dfn> of the Arabs,
the <dfn>hyroob</dfn> of the Hebrews, the <ins title="meson" lang="el">μέσον</ins> of the Greeks,
and the <dfn>impluvium</dfn> or <dfn>cavadium</dfn> of the Romans.</p>

<p>The patio is covered with an awning, which the
Moors call <dfn>clas</dfn>; they have also a covering for the
floor, which they use on festivities, and which they
call <dfn>yellis</dfn>: the <dfn>clas</dfn>, the same as the <dfn>velum</dfn>, which
the Romans spread over their atrium—in Greek it
was <ins title="tegê" lang="el">τέγη</ins>. The roof was
<ins title="tegos" lang="el">τέγος</ins>, hence the confusion
respecting the paralytic man being let down “through
the roof” <ins title="tegê" lang="el">τέγη</ins>, which was simply the removal of the
tent or awning to let him down, not into the house,
but into the court. They ascended to the roof
among the tiles,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_245"></a><a href="#footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a></span>
and unroofed the roof,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_246"></a><a href="#footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></span> and so
let down the bed into the middle. Here are all
familiar words, and nothing can be plainer than the
words, however incomprehensible may be the thing
conveyed; for how should a roof be unroofed
(<ins title=" apestegatên tên stegên" lang="el">ἀπεστεγάτην τὴν στεγὴν</ins>),
and how should the people below
have remained quiet under the tiles and rafters?
But, translate the passage by the aid of the Moorish
house, and all difficulty is removed: “They ascended
to the top of the house, among the tiles (<ins title="anabantes epi to dôma dia
tôn keramôn" lang="el">ἀναβάντες ἐπὶ τὸ δῶμα διὰ τῶν κεράμων</ins>);
and then, removing
the awning which was spread over the place where
he was, they let him down into the patio.” The
tiles were for flooring the terrace-top, and coping the
parapet walls. Thus the centre of the house remained,
as it were, the tent, and explains the passage,
“the tabernacle of my house;” as also that one,
“Thou spreadest out the heavens as a curtain;” and
again, “He stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain,
and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in.”</p>

<p>The French word <i lang="fr">maison</i> comes from the Greek
<ins title="messon" lang="el">μέσσον</ins>, <dfn>architecture</dfn>. The French house is a solid
figure, the ancient house a hollow one. The building
of the house in Greek is <ins title="oikos" lang="el">οἶκος</ins>: the court in the
middle is called <ins title="messon" lang="el">μέσσον</ins>. The families of the poor
inhabit different apartments: the court becomes the
common place of resort, and its name will stand for
that of the whole dwelling, as “hall” in English is,
in the country, used to designate a gentleman’s seat.
But here it is the abode of the lower orders, which
would undergo the change, and the word would
become vernacular: <ins title="oikos" lang="el">οἶκος</ins> becoming <ins title="messon" lang="el">μέσσον</ins>, we have
at once <dfn>maison</dfn>. In Spain, common courts are called
<dfn>meson coral</dfn>. <dfn>Coro</dfn>, <dfn>coral</dfn>, <dfn>corte</dfn> came, in like manner,
to signify residence of the monarch: thus, the Court
of Madrid. (“<cite lang="es">Solo Madrid es
corte.</cite>”)<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_247"></a><a href="#footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>Architecture spread in France from the Phocian
colony of Marseilles, and through Europe from the
peninsula, and so the one word spread in France,
the other through Europe. It is curious that the
French word for a house should mean the same thing
as the English word for a chamber, both being in
direct contradiction to the thing conveyed, which is
not “space,” but “enclosure.”</p>

<p>This form of Canaanitish building is preserved in
our monasteries, cloisters, and colleges. Spain and
Sicily preserve some beautiful specimens of the passage
of Moorish into Gothic forms, where the luxury
and gaiety of the <dfn>woost</dfn> is associated with the sombre
severity of the cloister,—the stone-framed and fretted
Gothic arches and windows—the Moorish tiles—the
gloomy corridors around, and flowers smiling in the
centre amidst water and refreshed by fountains.</p>

<p>To the apartment of the chief of the establishment
there was an entrance-hall twelve feet square and
sixteen to eighteen feet high; the floor red like the
court, and the walls white. A balcony at one side,
reached by a ladder, served for two or three persons
to sleep, and gave entrance to a small “chamber on
the wall,” such as that of Elisha in the house of the
Shunamite. The “upper chamber,” such as David’s,
“over the gate,” judging from what we at present
see, was a building on the roof, being reached by a
ladder or external staircase:—a ladder is a common
domestic instrument. The chambers built there are
strictly <dfn>beit</dfn>; but to the westward it receives the
name from the Arabs of <dfn>olea</dfn>, which is the word in
the Old Testament translated “upper chamber.” It
was the <dfn>hyperoon</dfn> of the Greeks, in which Homer
places Penelope to <dfn>avoid</dfn> her suitors. The Lacedemonians
called the same apartment <dfn>oon</dfn>; and Athenæus
explains by it the fable of Helen born from an
egg. The <dfn>gynaicum</dfn> of the Greeks was the upper
story; and at present, amongst the Moors, who have
no harem for the women, the tops of the houses are
appropriated to them, and no man can ascend to
make repairs, or for any other purpose, without proclaiming
aloud three times that he is going up to
the roof. David, in the story of Bathsheba, was
clearly where he ought not to have been, and where
no man was expected to be, and had neglected to
give the customary warning.</p>

<p>But this door, or archway, led to the inner apartment,—one
of the ordinary long Moorish rooms,
about seven feet wide and thirty feet long, and receiving
light only from the door. The floor was
covered with their beautiful mats, and the walls all
round, to the height of four feet: the rest was white.
The entrance to these rooms is by the centre, and
they thus form separate apartments to the right and
left, at the end there being generally a raised bed
divided off by hangings. When I first saw the bedsteads,
I took them for an imitation of us, for they
are altogether repugnant to Eastern ideas. In the
East a bed-room is unknown: even in the harem
there is no apartment so appropriated, far less is there
a bed-stead. Where “bed-rooms” are mentioned,
what is meant is a place for stowing beds. Large
presses are filled at the “lower” parts of rooms for
this purpose. The bed, when made, is taken out and
raised three or four mattresses, one over the other.
In the centre of the <dfn>oda</dfn> it looks like a long ottoman.
The pillows are composed as a “formation” of very
thin, broad flaps or cushions of cotton, so that you get
exactly the required height, and they fit into the neck,
and do not require a head-board to keep them in.
No standing post is required; and all this is from
the matrix of the tent. Here it is exactly the reverse,
and might well surprise at first. The matrix here is
the fortress, the walled cities of Canaan. Here every
apartment is a bedroom: not only are the beds composed
of standing posts, but they are the standing
parts of the rooms, divided off by hangings, like
those of the Temple, for it is not curtains round
them, but hangings that are before them. The room
is built of the width requisite for them. There is
sometimes a standing top, which serves as a balcony,
and also to sleep on. The bed is called <dfn>farash</dfn>, the
hangings <dfn>numasia</dfn>, and there are generally behind two
square holes through the wall, for light and air.</p>

<p><dfn>Mittah</dfn> is the word used in Scripture: it is spoken
of as a standing thing, and the expression <dfn>going up</dfn>,
exactly corresponds with what we see here. The standing
bedstead of Og King of Bashan is referred to in
testimony of his gigantic dimensions. At a feast the
Moors place the honoured person in the bed. On marriage-feasts
the bridegroom, amidst his party, and the
bride amidst hers, recline on the bed. When a <i lang="fr">fête</i> is
made in honour of any person, he is placed on the
bed, looking down on the parties assembled round the
trays, the whole length of the room. It might, in fact,
be translated rather throne than bed.</p>

<p>So also at a Jewish wedding, you may see in one
bed three tiers of blooming virgins, sparkling in gold
and jewels, with their shot green and red silk handkerchiefs—and
within the hangings of one curtain,
one bouquet, presenting more beauty than you could
select from any European court.</p>

<p>In the Highlands a strange piece of furniture is the
bedstead, which is of wood, with doors like a press,
and standing enclosed and against the wall: it is,
doubtless, derived from the customs I describe. The
Highlanders used to make these bedsteads themselves,
as Ulysses did his.</p>

<p>A peculiarity of the Moorish room is, that the beams
are visible, being ornamented with either carving or
colour, or both: this we have preserved in the grander
Gothic architecture. So it was among the Jews:
“Ceiled with cedar and painted with vermilion.”
Vermilion is the ground of their patterns, and predominates.
The colour is neither laid on with oil,
nor in fresco, but with white of egg; it works well
and lasts long. The beams are of the arar, which in
ancient and modern times has been confounded with
cedar.</p>

<p>In the Roman and Greek house, as in the Hebrew,
the rooms were entered from the centre court; but
the former had their greatest extension in the length,
that is from the court; the latter, in the breadth,
that is parallel to the court. The same contrast holds
between the Turkish and the Moorish. The former
has not the <dfn>Impluvium</dfn>, but the <dfn>Divan houé</dfn>, or central
hall of the house, corresponds to it; out of this
you pass to the rooms, which are squares, exactly as
Vitruvius describes the <dfn>Triclinium</dfn>, with a rectangle
added, the top being opposite the door and giving
the light, being nearly an unbroken side of
window.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_248"></a><a href="#footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></span>
The Moorish is the most complete antithesis, having
an extensive breadth; having two “tops” opposite
each other; having no window, and receiving its light
from an enormous door. An apartment may be thirty
feet by seven feet, or in length nearly five times its
breadth. We have had at Nimroud the perfect confirmation
that this was the ancient form in the East:
the same proportions are there observed in far grander
dimensions.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_249"></a><a href="#footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></span>
Mr. Layard accounts for the form by
the want of timber to construct wider roofs; but that
would not give the inordinate length; and, besides,
they were acquainted—as he shows—with the arch.
The form being adopted to suit the settled manner,
and with reference to the bed, then of course the
heavy roof could be laid on with short beams; and
that the same masses of pounded earth for the terraces
were there employed as in Barbary, the condition of
the Assyrian ruins plainly shows. The Greeks had
a mixed architecture. They had the Phrygian tombs;
and they must have had also roofs made in this
fashion—at least, at an early time—as is recorded
in the story of Melampus; who, being confined by
Iphiklos, for attempting to carry off his cattle, heard
the worms in the roof discoursing on the unsafe condition
of the beams.</p>

<p>They have such gates as Samson carried from Gaza,
or Lord Ellenborough sent for to Cabul, and are
traced on the sepulchre of the kings at Jerusalem:
they do not fit into the wall, but lie against it. They
are not shaped to the arch; they close, but rectangularly
and folding; they cover it as the hurdle did
the orifice of the rush mosques I saw along the lake.
There is no hinge, but the joints of the door descend
into a socket in the stone, and in like manner the door
is secured above in a projecting bracket of wood. In
the smallest buildings it is colossal. To exclude the
air or the cold they close the folding doors, and open
a small wicket as in the gate of a fortress; above it
there are small apertures through the wall to let in
the light when it is closed, and these are arranged
in a figure or a pattern. Every corner of a Moorish
house is ornamented, although merely in the form
that is given to the whitewashed wall: there is no
glaring oil paint upon the doors; they are scrubbed
with ochre, which is left upon them.</p>

<p>In the apartment of a single old man there was
but one farash at one end; a European sofa occupied
the other. The floor was flush; and as I was examining
and admiring the building, he said to me, “It is
of my own construction. I don’t mean that I made
the plan, but that I hewed the stone, and carried the
mortar with my own hands.”</p>

<p>I paid a visit to this patriarch’s uncle; he was, of
course, very old, and though bedridden, had lost none
of his faculties. The whole family and a good many
of the neighbours were soon assembled around us, and
he unlocked the stores of his memory. He recollected
the accession of Soliman, the uncle of the present
Sultan, who reigned half a century. He then went
back to Mahmoud, whom he claimed as his “friend.”
I launched out in praise of the dignity of his reign,
and the justice of that of Soliman. He related various
anecdotes of both.</p>

<p>A governor brought presents of one hundred of
everything that the country contained: horses, oxen,
mules, sheep, slaves, quintals of silver, packets of gold-dust
(about a pound weight each), measures of corn,
oil, butter, &amp;c. The Sultan asked him whence came
this wealth. He said from the government which his
bounty had conferred upon him. He asked him if
the people had not paid their tenths. The governor
said they had. The Sultan then said, “I sent you to
govern, not to rob,” and gratified him with the bastinado
and prison.</p>

<p>The grandfather of Ben Abou, the present Governor
of Riff, when Caïd of Tangier, made a great feast at
the marriage of his daughter. One of his friends,
Caïd Mohammed Widden, observed a poor man in mean
attire in the court, and ordered him out; and, he not
obeying, pushed him so that he fell. That same night
the keeper of an oven (there are no sellers of bread,
every one makes his own bread at home and sends
it to the oven) had barred his door and retired
to rest, when some one knocked at the door. He
asked, “Who is there?” and was answered, “The
guest of God,” which means a beggar. “You are
welcome,” he said, and got up and unfastened the
door; and having nothing but some remnants of the
koscoussou from his supper, and the piece of mat upon
which he lay, he warmed the koscoussou in the oven,
and after bringing water to wash his guest’s hands,
he set it before him: he then conducted him to the
mat, and himself lay down on the bare ground.</p>

<p>In the morning when he awoke, he found the door
unbarred, and the poor man gone; so he said to himself,
“He had business and did not wish to disturb
me, or he went away modestly, being ashamed of his
poverty.” On taking up the mat he found under it
two doubloons; so he was afraid, and put the money
by, and determined not to touch it, lest it had been
forgotten, or lest the poor man had stolen it, and
put it there to ruin him.</p>

<p>Some time afterwards an order came from Fez for
Mohammed Widden and the baker to repair thither.
They were both conducted to the place before the
palace to await the Sultan’s coming forth. When he
appeared they were called before him, and, addressing
the first, he asked him if he recollected the feast at the
marriage of the daughter of the Caïd of Tangier, and
a poor man whom he had pushed with his left hand,
and kicked with his right foot. Then Caïd Mohammed
knew whom he had thus treated, and trembled.
The Sultan said, “The arm that struck me, and the
leg that kicked me, are mine: cut them off.” The
baker now said to himself, “If he has taken the leg and
the arm off the caïd, he will surely take my head,” so
he fell down upon the earth, and implored the Sultan
to have mercy upon him. The Sultan said to him:—“My
son, fear not; you were poor, and took in the
beggar when he was thrust forth from the feast of the
rich. He has eaten your bread, and slept on your
mat. Now ask whatever you please; it shall be yours.”
The caïd returned to Tangier maimed and a beggar,
and his grandson was lately a soldier at the gate of
the Sicilian consul. The baker returned riding on a
fine mule richly clothed, and possessed of the wealth
of the other; and the people used to say as he passed
by, “There goes the oven-keeper, the Sultan’s
host.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_250"></a><a href="#footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>The old man, however, went further back than
Mahmoud, and spoke a great deal of Ismael, who,
though doubtless a sanguinary monster, was one of
the most extraordinary men that has sat upon the
throne of Morocco. He constantly said of him, “Govenaba
mucho,” he governed much; and illustrated
this disposition as follows: “If a man spoke to a
woman in the streets he was immediately put to
death.”</p>

<p>The conversation falling on the Brebers, I asked
if they were really the people of Palestine driven out
by the Jews; upon which there was a general exclamation
of surprise, and even of anger. “Must not
we,” said the old man, “who are Jews, and the Brebers,
who are sons of Canaan, know what we are and
they are?” and then they all vociferated together:
“Have we not known them, and do we not know
them—the Yebusee, the Emoree, the Gieryesee, the
Hevee, the Perezee, the Canaanee, the Hytee, the Hurchee,
the Sunee, the Aarvadee; and are they not
known amongst their tribes to the present day? and
of the seven nations driven out, are there not four
still here? and did not Joshua drive them out, and
did not Joab the servant of David pursue them even
to the mountains above Fez?” And then one ran
for the Old Testament, and they commenced reading
passages, and giving names as used by them and
the corresponding names as used to-day amongst
the Moors, and explaining how the nations that had
been lost, had remained in the Holy Land and been
confounded there with the remnant of the other
people.</p>

<p>I must not here omit the honourable mention made
of the late British consul at Tangier, Mr. Hay. They
spoke of him with enthusiasm: his integrity and
affability were illustrated by anecdotes. Nor was
less said or felt towards Mrs. Hay,—her charity to
the poor, her attention to the sick. Repeatedly, when
Moors have been expressing to me their indignation
at England for inciting them to resist the French,
and then betraying them, they have paused to say
that it brought Mrs. Hay to her grave.</p>

<p>We spent a great portion of the night in conversation
on these subjects; but my host was constantly
turning to a matter that had the mastery of his
thoughts. He had two daughters-in-law: both were
barren. As I had been questioning him about the
hashish, and various other plants, nothing would
satisfy him but that I was deeply versed in such
matters, which the people of Morocco believe Christians
to be thoroughly acquainted with, and to be able to
control by
charms.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_251"></a><a href="#footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>He brought down a volume on physics, by Tudela, a
Jew of Adrianople, and insisted on having my opinion
on various fragments, which he translated. Familiar
as one is in this country with the longing for
children,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_252"></a><a href="#footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></span>
I never saw it so exemplified. Next morning
he called his two daughters-in-law, and presenting
them, said, “Now, look at them, and tell me if they
will have children.” I turned away to relieve them,
saying, “I know nothing of such matters;” but they
had no mind to be so relieved, and came themselves
right round before me.</p>

 “The great narrowness of all the rooms, when compared
with their length, appears to prove that the Assyrians had no
means of constructing a roof requiring other support than that
afforded by the side walls. The most elaborately ornamented
hall at Nimroud, although above one hundred and sixty feet in
length, was only thirty-five feet broad. The same disparity is
apparent in the edifice at Konyunjik. It can scarcely be
doubted that there was some reason for making the rooms so
narrow.”—<cite>Nineveh</cite>, <abbr title="volume 2, page">vol. ii. p.</abbr> 255.</p>

 An oven-keeper of Tangier, from whom I sought the verification
of this story, told me that it was not an oven-keeper who
had received the sultan, but a worker in iron named Mallem
Hamet. Mallem designates his calling, an honourable one here,
but so despicable among the wandering Arabs, that a conquered
foe has his life spared if he stretches out his arm as if beating
with a hammer: degraded by the act, his enemy will not condescend
to shed his blood.</p>

<h4 class="h4head"><span class="allsmcap">THE JEWS IN BARBARY.</span></h4>

<p class="p2">The conversation reported two or three pages back
respecting the origin of the Brebers, was among the
most interesting incidents of my trip. What would it
be to open a tomb, and find the sling of David or the
arrow of Jonathan, the bones of Joshua, or the sword
of Gideon? But what is it to find the very people,
firing as they spoke of the Jebusite and the Hittite—not
the traditions of the Holy Land, but of what
were ancient days to Jeremiah and Ezekiel!</p>

<p>The Jews that inhabit the sea-ports are the remnants
of those expelled from Spain at successive
periods during the last twelve hundred years, and
they are but a step by which to approach the Jews of
the mountains, who have undergone less change, but
have become savage and illiterate. Amongst them lie
concealed treasures of ancient lore, and by them are
presented varieties of human existence worthy of
inviting adventurous research.</p>

<p>A lady at Tangier told me of a Jew who some years
ago had come to inquire his way at the door, and who
was quite unintelligible to either Jews or Arabs. He
was from the mountains above Tâfilêlt, wore a different
dress—which she could not describe, but said it was
black—and had upon his feet sandals, tied in the
antique fashion, the cords passing between the toes.
I found in the journal of Mr. Davidson, sent here after
his death, and who crossed the Atlas to the south of
Morocco, and spent six months in Sus, some slight
but interesting details.</p>

<p>“I went in the evening to dine with the Jews,
here called the sons of Yehúdi: they are a most
extraordinary people. I never met with such hospitality,
or such freedom of manner in any Jews. They
had dancing and music, and the ladies mixed in
society without the least restraint.”—(<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 58.)</p>

<p>“I received a visit from some Jews, who stated,
that they have here the tombs of two rabbis who
escaped from the <em>second</em> destruction of Jerusalem.
Over the mountain opposite there is a valley equal to
the plain of Morocco, where dwell, say the Jews, those
who escaped from Nebuchadnezzar.”—(<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 61.)</p>

<p>“In both Riff and Sus the Jews go armed; they
are, however, the property of the Moors, who arm, and
send them out as a sort of substitute, and by whom
they are supported, and allowed a greater liberty than
at Tangiers. In the mountains in the neighbourhood
of Tangiers, the Jews act as guards to conduct the
Moors. They have a master, whose shoe they carry,
which serves as a protection. They pay tribute, not
in money, but in work, the Moors finding the former.
The principal trade is in grain and oil. The masters
are Brebers, all of whom ride mules. Every douar has
its sheikh and caïd, who are Moors, and possess
each a jurisdiction, but not the power of punishing
in all cases. Their religious worship is the same
as the other, but little cared about. In the whole
valley there may be about five hundred. They have
their sacred books, synagogue, and rabbis; and they
make a pilgrimage to the tombs, distant two and
three days’ journey. All the douars have large vineyards,
and manufactories of haïks, carpets, &amp;c., which
are sent to Tangiers. They do not speak Arabic, but
Breber or Shelluh.”</p>

<p>“He (a rabbi) informed me, that in this place
(Coubba) there are no less than 3000 or 4000 Jews
living in perfect freedom, and following every variety
of occupation; that they have mines and quarries,
which they work; possess large gardens and extensive
vineyards, and cultivate more corn than they can
possibly consume. That they have a form of government,
and have possessed this soil from the time of
Solomon; in proof of which he stated, that they
possess a record bearing the signet and sign of Joab,
who came to collect tribute from them in the time of
the son of David; that the tradition of their arrival
here runs thus:—</p>

<p>“‘<cite>Crossing the great sea to avoid the land of Egypt</cite>,
they came to a head of land with a river; that here
they landed, and following the course of this, leading
westward, but going towards the south, they came to
a spot where they found twelve wells and seventy
palm-trees. This, at first, led them to suppose that
they had by some means got to Elim; but finding the
mountains on the west, they were satisfied that they
had reached a new country. Finding a passage over
the mountains, they crossed, and took up their dwelling
in this valley, first in caves, which exist in great
numbers, then in others which they excavated; and
after this began to build towns. That, at a distant
period, they were driven across the mountains by a
people that would not acknowledge them, and that
some remained at Diminet, Mesfywa, and other places
on the western side of the range.’</p>

<p>“Looking at the map, and following this man’s
observations, it is perfectly easy to trace them. They
must have reached the Gulf of Tremesen, and taking
the river Muluwia, or Mahala, have reached Tâfilêlt,
where, to this day, are twelve wells, planted round
with seventy palm-trees, and which many of the Jews
call Elim; and from this they must have taken the
pass, to which I attempted to get.</p>

<p>“I was most anxious to know the meaning of the
names of some of the towns. He told me, that what
the Moors call Mesfywa is Oom Siwá, the mother of
Siwá, one of their families which crossed the mountains;
that Ouríka of the Moors, distant thirty miles,
was Rebka (Rebecca), founded by one of their daughters,
and that most of these places had originally
Hebrew names. At Ouríka he left me. I continued
for eight days to visit the towns inhabited by the
Jews, to the number of above one hundred, and I
should say, that on this side there are more Jews
dwelling with the Brebers in the mountains, than
resident in Morocco. They have all the same account
of Coubba, and have a great belief in the Cabalists,
who, they say, still exist, and who receive direct
communication from heaven.”—(<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 193.)</p>

<p>Here the Jews are an agricultural, industrious, and
warlike race. Here is each township distinct, preserving
its distinct traditions. Here are the settlements
at successive periods. There are the emigrants
after the second destruction, as distinguished from
those of the first. Then there are those who came by
sea, and those who came through Egypt, who “did not
go to the Babylonish captivity.”</p>

<p>When Nebuchadnezzar besieged Jerusalem, he was
compelled by the Egyptians to retire, and the Jews
looking to Egypt for support, and fearing the return
of the Chaldeans, Jeremiah denounced the vengeance of
Heaven against them, and prophesied that those who
went to Egypt never should see their own land
again.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_253"></a><a href="#footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></span>
Jeremiah himself was taken to Egypt. He again
announced the destruction of that country by the
Chaldeans, which he typified by burying the stones
over which the throne of Nebuchadnezzar was to be
raised. On the invasion of Egypt by the Chaldeans,
the Jews would naturally have fled a second time.
It was from the “north country” that fear was coming.
They must have fled towards the west. The prophet
had announced that they were not to see the land of
their fathers again; and the Jewish peasants inhabiting
Mount Atlas, at a distance of two thousand
four hundred years, tell us, that they left Jerusalem
before the Babylonish captivity. While this is a
remarkable confirmation of the accuracy of the Jewish
records, and of the fulfilment of a prophecy the
accomplishment of which had not been recorded, it
gives at the same time to the traditions of these
people the weight and force of historical record.</p>

<p>One of their traditions is, that Nebuchadnezzar invaded
Spain, attacked the Tyrians at Cadiz, and carried
with him in his armies many Jews to Spain, who were
afterwards colonized in these countries. This account
has hitherto been disregarded because there is no
historical evidence for it. The tradition is, however,
confirmed by the name of the ancient capital, Toledo—Toledoth,
or the generations with Ascalon, so often
repeated in the names of old Spanish cities, Jaffa, and
the others enumerated by Mariana. The translator
of A1 Makhari mentioned to me the discovery at
Toledo of an old manuscript, in Jewish character, but
not Hebrew, and which he supposed to be a sign
of the Jews, who had settled in Spain previous to the
Carthaginian conquest, having adopted the original
language of Spain, as their successors have the Spanish.
Mr. Davidson found great disinclination to speak on
the dispersion of the tribes. I have also remarked it
in a Jew from Fez; and it suggested to me a
new explanation of the supposed loss of the ten
tribes.</p>

<p>The Barbary Jews all profess themselves to be of
the tribe of Benjamin. When I asked the Jew, how a
tribe almost extinguished, and the least of the tribes
of Israel, should, to the exclusion of all the rest, have
supplied the whole of the Jewish population now in
the west, he answered by referring to the promise to
the seed of Benjamin, and, as if inwardly recurring to
the other promise to the tribe of Judah, he added, “But
we are also of the tribe of Judah, and the two are
mixed together.” It immediately occurred to me, that
they made a point of asserting the tribe of Judah
still to exist, as preserving the future application of
the prophecy regarding the Messiah, and that they
brought in the kingdom of Judah, and the two tribes
of which it was composed, as the source from which
they sprang, and that thence arose the habit of speaking
of the ten tribes as being lost. There can be no
doubt that the successive emigrations to Spain and
to Barbary while the two kingdoms still remained
distinct, were composed of all the tribes, but in the
loss of their several inheritances and separate governments,
they had become confounded in their new
settlements.</p>

<p>When this Jew was asserting his descent from Judah,
it occurred to me to ask him to say <cite>shibboleth</cite>. He
was confounded, but attempted again and again, and
could not accomplish it. He was very angry.</p>

<p>The resemblance to ancient Canaan is thus described
by the illiterate master of a vessel, shipwrecked upon
the coast and carried into the interior:—</p>

<p>“After leaving the Great Desert, and coming to the
country of Sus, we entered on an extensive plain;
and we were struck at the same moment with the
sight of several villages, surrounded with high stone
walls, with gates and towers; and I was told that
each of these was an independent state, and under the
command or government of its own chief, who generally
gave himself the title of Prince. When I learnt
the destruction of Widnoon, and the other devastations
of the wandering Arabs, I could not help reflecting—and
I made the remark to my companions—that the
province of Sus was what Canaan must have been in
the time of Joshua, in respect to its numerous walled
towns, the fertility of its soil, and several other
respects; and that the eruptions of the Arabs of the
Desert resembled much the conduct of the ancient
Israelites when they came out of the Desert into the
cultivated country.”</p>

<h4 class="h4head"><span class="allsmcap">TANGIER.</span></h4>

<p class="p2">From Arzela to Tangier there are two roads, one by
the interior and one by the beach. Not far from the
former are the Druidical remains. I, however, preferred
the shore-road, not to lose the sight of that splendid
tumult of waters. We started a little before full-tide.
Here there were no cliffs or rocks along the beach, but
flat, open, sand; and in advance of the shore, at about
a quarter of a mile, there was generally a bank, along
which I walked the greater part of the day barefoot,
having now and then to fly before the sudden sweep
of a larger wave. I learnt the difference between
walking with the foot that God had given us, and
stumping in the cases constructed by man. Nothing
could be more beautiful than the bank of foam seaward.
The waves began breaking about a mile off,
and there were generally three permanent cataracts,
stretching as far as I could see, this way and that, but
at times I could count seven or eight successive lines
of surf, which, constantly rolling, appeared nevertheless
permanent waterfalls: beyond, the sea was smooth,
calm, and there was no wind. This was the coast in
its mildest mood, and under its most favourable
aspect. In the middle of the day the sea-breeze
came in at about ten knots an hour, and swept before
it with each wave sheets of foam, radiating with
prismatic colours. The coast is strewed with fragments
of ships and bones of sharks. The Arabs will
sometimes burn large masses of timber merely to get
the nails that may be in them. To the south it often
happens that whales are wrecked on the coast.</p>

<p>Within about five miles of Cape Spartel, I observed
one of the most beautiful effects of the pattern figures
of the sand, and I mention it as being within the
reach of a ride from Tangier. There appeared to be
a stream rising along the ground: it was the fine sand
carried inland by the wind; and in this neighbourhood
it has since been observed to me by persons who
had themselves marked the change, that the sand
was gaining upon the cultivated land. It is this, I
imagine, that has led to the belief prevalent amongst
the Europeans in this country, that the sand along
the coast of Morocco has been thrown up by the sea;
but the sand thus carried inward is but dust in the
balance compared with that enormous stratum which
constitutes the maritime border of the country, and
which is battened down by a skin of rock. The
edges of this mass of sand are worn by the waters, and
a slight portion is blown inwards by the wind; but the
mass itself has been the load of an ocean, and carried to
where it now rests, from the interior of Africa itself.</p>

<p>I may here mention the caves of Cape Spartel, which
I subsequently visited. A couple of miles southward
of the Cape there is a flat, projecting rock, about
sixty feet high: it is composed of a hard and porous
conglomerate, which forms excellent mill-stones; and
it seems to have been used from all antiquity for that
purpose. The summit bears towards the land the
remains of Phœnician walls; the rock is in all directions
burrowed for the mill-stones; they are cut about
two and a half feet in diameter. They chisel them all
round; then break off the part with wedges; and this
scooping out has a most singular effect. The rock is
so hard that parts are left standing only a few inches
thick, and, like open trellis-work, over which you may
scramble. Forty feet above the surf, and projecting
over it, there are two large caves open to the sea, into
which the waves dash with fury. These, though
greatly extended by the scooping for the mill-stones,
were natural caverns, and no doubt one of them must
have been the cave of Hercules. Even within the last
few years a considerable portion of the rock has fallen
away. There is in one a dome, with a circular aperture
in the centre. The rock is all pierced through like
a large warren: it contains cavities filled up with sand
and bones, like the Kirkdale caves of Yorkshire.</p>

<p>It was dark when we reached Tangier: the gate of
the city was already closed, though I had sent one of
the soldiers in advance. The gate of the citadel was,
however, opened for our admission. On issuing from
the gate of the fortress, we came in sight of the city
below us, shining like a congregation of glowworms.
There was not a light to be seen—yet all was light,
shaded, mellowed, and phosphoric. There were here
no lamp-posts in the streets, and no windows in the
houses, through which their lights could be seen: the
white walls of the interior courts were illuminated
with a blue reflected light, which produced an optical
delusion; from the want of a direct ray to measure the
distance, the lighted surfaces seemed remote, and the
town swelled into magnificence of proportion. It was,
indeed, but for a moment, for the sun soon corrected
the error of the eye.</p>

<p>I reached the door of Miss Duncan, who renders
Tangier habitable for Europeans, in such a condition
that, when it was opened and light brought, it was
about to be closed against me as a mad santon, my
scanty habiliments, a shirt and drawers, being torn
with briars and disfigured with mud, while the arms
and legs fared no better. Great was the surprise when
from such a body proceeded an English appeal for
shelter, and within an hour I was seated on a chair at
a table, before a fire of sea-coal, with grate, fender,
and fire-irons. On the table stood cruet-stand, knife
and fork, Staffordshire plates, and Scotch broth. While
marvelling at the sight, in rushed Hamed with a
steaming dish—“Me know you like Moors’ kuscoussoo.”</p>

<p>The journey from Rabat, a distance of one hundred
and twenty miles, had taken me a week of toil and
fatigue. The difficulties, from the season of the year,
were, however, the charm of the trip; the weather
was mild and beautiful, but the roads—if they can be
so called—were heavy and deep. This, comparatively
speaking, would have mattered little, if we had been
well mounted; our animals were, I think, the worst I
ever journeyed with, and the charge the most exorbitant
I ever paid. I could have bought them outright for one-third
more than the sum I gave for the week’s hire. The
charges for the soldiers were in proportion, and I found
that this journey had cost me in time and in money,
the same as posting from Calais to Naples. Each soldier
received for his week’s journey, the price of an ox.</p>

<p>Coming from the south, Tangier was a very different
object than when I crossed the Straits to visit it, as a
specimen of Barbary. In fact, it is a place equally
foreign to both. The Moors designate it, “Infidel,”
like the Giaour of the Turks. It is the only place
where Europeans reside, and there is here a mixture
of all classes, Brebers, Moors, Jews, and Europeans,
living promiscuously together.</p>

<p>On the cession of the place by the English, it became
the property of the Sultan, who offered it to
the Brebers, thinking by that means to fix them in
the towns. Some hundred families accepted the
offer, but their example has not been followed by the
rest. They seem originally to have enjoyed a very
free government, by their own municipal body, which
consisted of twelve, and who each in turn was governor
of the city for a month.</p>

<p>The fortifications present a strange jumble of the
structure of all ages, but the only chiselled remains
that I saw were Roman, being capitals, and shafts of
Corinthian columns.</p>

<p>The town stands on a deep mass of the relics of
former habitations. The Danish consulate has recently
been rebuilt, and in some places they dug twenty
feet below the present level. Twelve feet below the
surface there were found Roman tombs, and eight
feet below these, round black jars containing fragments
of burnt bones similar to those which have
been found in mounds in Denmark. I could see none
of them, as they had been all sent to Denmark to
the king. A portion of a fine Roman bridge still
stands, leading from Tangier across the river, in the
direction of the northern coast. It resembles the
Flavian bridge at Rome, and is fifteen feet broad
between the parapets: an old engraving of the
city, when in possession of the English, represents
the port crowded with vessels. It was in form nearly
triangular, the apex being at the entrance three hundred
and fifty fathoms from the base. Two moles
were run out, one protecting it from the north-east,
the other from the north-west: these were destroyed
when we surrendered the place.</p>

<p>From here you command a perfect view through the
Straits. It is impossible not to be struck with its
superiority over Gibraltar, while the moles existed.
Here you are to windward: with easterly winds you
may work through with the current’s aid, and with
westerly winds you are far enough out of its draught to
be able to get away to the westward. There is, however,
a position close by, which is superior to it. It is
a cove two miles to the westward, and at the point
of the cape. It would require, indeed, some clearance
out of the sand, and the addition of a breakwater
at each of the horns: there is good anchorage
before it, and nothing more to be feared than from the
north. The coast of Spain terminating at Trafalgar
breaks the sea from the north, and the northerly
wind never blows home, as the various influences of
the Straits change it here either into an east or
a west wind. The Americans some years ago cast
their eyes on this position, and wished to obtain
it as their Mediterranean emporium, and they offered
a large sum of money for it to the Government of
Morocco.</p>

<p>Above this cove is situated a house that has been
constructed by an English gentleman. It had been
several months untenanted, and though there is a
road passing close behind it, nothing had been
touched. There was on the steps of the door a
child’s toy—a cart—just as it had been left weeks
before; some of the panes of glass were broken,
but this had been done by the pigeons. Garden
implements were lying about. During two years
that the proprietor has resided there, he had locked
nothing up, and lost nothing. There are in the
neighbourhood several villages, and no stipendiary
magistrate, or rural police.</p>

<p>There is here a restricted but agreeable society
of the foreign agents, and a most imposing assemblage
of flag-staffs—or rather masts—which are struck
and housed in bad weather, and which exhibit fore
and back stays, cross-trees, rigging, rattlings, halyards,
&amp;c., giving to the flat roofs of their habitations
the appearance of decks, and making them look like
so many vessels, wanting only their yards to be
crossed, and their sails to be bent. In their nautical
pretensions, they are, however, beaten by the English
consul at Cadiz, who hoists a pendant, and whose
porter pipes a guest up the stairs with a boatswain’s
call.</p>

<p>Amidst the consular masts with their floating standards
and streaming pendants, which make the town
look from without rather like a dockyard than a city,
there is not one that bears the blue cross of St. Andrew.
There was the agent of the young republic
of the West at work trying to involve France and
Morocco with a view to the settlement of the
Oregon question against England, while the profound
cabinet of the North is so heedless of Morocco as not
to have even a consul there. Nay, Russia is positively
so ignorant of the commonest facts connected with this
country, that, when appealed to recently in an affair
concerning it, she replied that she considered it as
a <em>portion of Turkey</em>.</p>

<p>The circumstances attending the appointment of the
present American consul are curious. He had been
consul here formerly, and on no good terms with
the authorities. The Moors are very particular in
seeing to whoever embarks from this place, and the
foreign agents, of course, always give previous notice
of their intention. The American consul on taking
his departure, not only gave no such notice, but announced
his intention of not doing so. The Pacha,
therefore, sent orders to the Porte to prevent the embarkation
of any one without permission. He was,
consequently, stopped at the gate, on which he drew
his sword, and a very violent scene occurred. An
infraction of the law of nations in his inviolable person,
&amp;c.—protest, commotion—the learned consular
body sign—all nations, all Christendom was attacked—and
the farce would have been enough for a war, had
it occurred in Turkey or Mexico. The United States
had, however, as yet no mission of civilization in Morocco,
and took no notice of the affair; but, upon
the accession of Mr. Polk, the bearing of Morocco
upon England and France was to have been reconsidered,
and the discarded consul sent back without
any previous settlement of the quarrel. When the news
reached Morocco, the government was greatly troubled,
and after enlisting the good services of the French
agent, transmitted a statement of the case to the
government of the United States, waving the right of
the Emperor to refuse to admit their agent, and leaving
it for the American government to judge whether
such a person was fit to be the channel of intercourse
between two friendly governments; and this representation
was to be backed by the French minister at
Washington.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Mr. Carr arrived at Gibraltar.
The Moorish government resolved to say to him,
that they would receive him as a private person,
but could not admit him as consul, as they had submitted
the case to his government. But the part
had been rehearsed also on the other side, and to
better purpose. Mr. Carr came with two frigates.
On the Pacha’s making his concerted speech, he was
answered by the naval commander: “I don’t know
anything about the matter. I have orders to bring
here the consul of the United States; will you receive
him or not, yes or no?” on which the caïd
said, that he was ready to receive him, if the naval
officer would give him a paper, saying that he constrained
him to do so. This was the same functionary
who had negotiated with the French, under the
threat of having a pistol ball through his head, and
signed the treaty of Tangier without ever having
read it; this is the person, in whose hands are placed
the foreign relations of Morocco; who has property
transferred to France, and who is openly charged
with giving bribes to foreign agents, and receiving
bribes from foreign governments.</p>

<p>There is a beautiful walk from the upper part of
Tangier, along the crest of the hill to the cove, so
coveted by the Americans. It retains the name it
had when the English were here, of Marchand; the
boys appropriate it for a game which is evidently
the origin of billiards; it is played with two balls
of iron, and a ring, which just admits them. The
object is to pocket the ball through the ring; they
play several on a side. Instead of cues they use a
piece of wood, of the form of the old sacrificial
knife, with which they impel the ball by a sweeping
motion, drawing its edge along the ground.</p>

<p>The ball is called <dfn>bola</dfn>, the ring <dfn>Arabi</dfn>. This
game flourishes particularly at Tangier, where the
boy population has profited by the liberal distribution
of grape made by the French. The children in
Morocco are distinguished for their games;—I have
seen leap-frog performed in a manner which would
not have disgraced an English clown in a pantomime.
They are dexterous in the use of the single
stick, and they have a mimic imitation of the powder
game of the men, which resembles the French game
called <dfn>barre</dfn>. They have blindman’s buff, and hunt
the slipper, which must be Moorish; and hunt the
slipper and blindman’s buff are combined in one,
for they must strike the ground with a slipper, and
having done so, must not leave the spot if the blinded
man approaches them. At the entrance of all the
towns we found, it being holiday time, whirligigs.
No inconsiderable portion of Moorish art is expended
on toys: there are drums of pottery-ware, a tube
covered with parchment at one end, with the other
open, such as were used amongst the Jews, and may
be detected among the Egyptians.</p>

<p>The habits of children are not to be neglected in
the history of nations, for they are a primitive and
original community transmitting their mariners to their
successors, distinct from the nation of adults, and
flowing as a pure source into the turbid stream, and
age after age struggling against it.</p>

<p>I must enumerate the peculiarities of this land
before quitting it, although, indeed, every thing that
exists in it is a peculiarity; for when they do things
like other people, they have no more taken it from
them than one man borrows from another the way to
breathe.</p>

<p>They have a form of room, tesselated and open
court, vermilioned and cedar beams, lofty arch and
thick-set column conjoined, carving of wood, fretting
of walls, colouring in patterns and assortment of
colours, doors, windows, brackets, stables, kitchens,
store-houses, water-closets, and tomb-stones,—all unlike
what is to be seen east or west, north or south.
They have carpets like other people, but in their own
style; they have mats, but the figure is Moorish;
they have caps, the form is their own; they have
shoes, again, as unlike Eastern slippers as European
boots; they have towels (our name comes from them)
but they are unlike ours; so they have pottery, embroidery,
and even the use of the needle. Using the
same letters as the Persians and the Turks, the Moors
have an entirely distinct set of their own instruments
of penmanship. They have one national dish. Unlike
any thing else that is practised amongst men, so is
their costume. It is a nation living under tents, and
yet excelling all others in the composition of materials
for fortresses and the structure of gigantic walls.
It is a people that has combined nomade habits with
the settled distribution of property. Jewelry is, again,
their own; so are their toys and their children’s
games, the head-dresses of the women, the plaiting
of the hair, their cosmetics, the substances with which
they wash; and if they have, in common with Easterns,
the bath, it here, again, assumes a style that is
Moorish.</p>

<p>What is chiefly remarkable, is the absence of all
things that are not in taste. There is no repetition
of chintz patterns used for adornments of wall or
floor; there is no glazed or glaring oil paint; there
are no pictures or prints hung for ornament sake; no
gilt and gaudy frames round these unsuited to the
apartments in which they are placed. Upon their
persons there are no repetitions of figures, no interminable
variety of tints, and no false ones. Some
centuries ago, I might have increased the list of the
peculiarities of Morocco, such as the use of candles
for giving light; of bells to call servants; of knockers
to announce visitors; of straw hats to shade off the
sun; of a different sort of meal in the morning and
in the evening; tambourine and crochet work and
lace, to occupy ladies’ fingers or adorn their persons;
of patches for their cheeks; of that beautiful leather
of various colours known by this country’s name, of
inlaid leathern patterns; of vases of ancient figure.</p>

<p>The Moors, with the art requisite to produce works
admirable and exquisite, are in the rudest stage of
early craft, and have no less avoided adopting from
us any process or any improvement than they have
been careful to exclude our corruptions of style and
manners. They have not got our plough or our
wheel, or our roads, or even the common pump: they
have not got a turning lathe or a shuttle; though
they have Morocco <em>leather</em>, they have no tanning vats;
they make the most exquisite silks without a throwing
machine; and with the most admirable woollens
they know not the manufacture of cloth. They have
never drawn the metals from their rich mines; they
still preserve the incantations and divinations of the
earliest times; they have perfumes and incense, secrets
and mysteries, yet in use in every house. Their maladies
are their own—elephantiasis and biblical leprosy;
the travelling scourge of plague visits them not, and
yet they have a plague of their own. And, finally,
they have an intoxicating drug differing from all
other people; they have neither recourse to wine,
spirits, nor opium; they have a plant, the produce of
their own country, presenting to them, when so disposed,
delusions and forgetfulness. Their permanency—as
their peculiarities—may be compared to, but
exceed, those of China. The Tartars are masters of
Chinese, amounting in numbers to half the human
race, to whom they have not given their religion; the
same Tartars have not been able to subjugate fifteen
millions of Moors, of the same religion. In the
midst of the world of conquest, enterprise, commerce,
and letters, they have repelled the invading arms of
Christians and Mussulmans united; they have been
overawed by no superiority of strength or display
of science, and neither has fallacy of speech or temptation
of gain seduced them into courses which their
simple instinct told them might ultimately compromise
their independence. The stranger from Europe
is welcomed in every tent, and kindly treated by
every Moor. The things of Europe are eschewed
by the community. They are a people of thirty
centuries, before whom we, with our institutions
and our ideas, are as insects of yesterday. This
people has outlived the Phœnicians. It has seen in
its rise and passage, decline and fall, the star of
Rome. It has shaken off, after having bent before,
the Gothic yoke and the Vandal scourge; conquering,
it converted Spain into a garden; beaten, it retired
home. It arrested on its shores the following tide
of invasion; it has kept out modern change—may it
not yet be destined to survive and to see, too, to
their end, the things even of our proud day?</p>

<p>Elsewhere, the records of antiquity are to be sought
in characters traced on marble or on brass; but
here they are to be found in the living men;—not
the traces of their early antiquity as that of the
Chinese, because <em>they</em> have not changed, but of ours.
Coming from a common source, flowing from a common
fountain, the streams of our waters have been mingled
and overcharged, and here we see what with us was
in the beginning—the key to the legends of Mythology,
the original of the pictures of Homer, the
source of the metaphors of the prophets, the people
of the old covenant reserved to our day, and the
source of the religious practices accompanied by which
Christianity appeared and settled itself in Europe.</p>

<h4 class="h4head"><span class="allsmcap">DRUIDICAL CIRCLES NEAR
TANGIER.—CONNEXION OF THE
CELTS WITH THE ANCIENT POPULATION OF MAURITANIA
AND SPAIN.</span></h4>

<p class="p2">By taking the sea-road, I missed the Druidical
circle, and although I stayed some time at Tangier,
I was too constantly engaged to make an excursion
so far. Mr. Davidson has mentioned them in his
journal as follows:—</p>

<p>“Coming round the side of a hill, you perceive
several stones forming a circle, of which one, called
the Peg, is much higher than the rest: there is
likewise a second circle. The whole neighbourhood
is full of similar circles of stones, but smaller: many
of the latter have been worked artificially. The
entrance to the circle, which is fifteen feet wide,
faces the west; on the north and south of the Peg
are two openings at equal distances. At about
the distance of two hundred feet, there is a stone
placed at an angle of 45°, intending, it is said, to
mark the opening; it is six feet high, and by lying
on the back, one can see directly through the circle.”</p>

<p>Discoveries of a similar kind have been made in
the regency of Tunis,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_254"></a><a href="#footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></span>
and cinerary vases have been
dug up at Tangier, in sinking a well at the Danish
consulate, at the depth of twenty feet, being eight
feet deeper than Roman tombs. These have been
sent to Copenhagen, and it is said, identified with
pottery found in the North of Europe. A cromlech
has also been discovered on the banks of the
Jordan,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_255"></a><a href="#footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a></span>
and in the vicinity of
Tyre.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_256"></a><a href="#footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>I was not aware of the existence of this monument,
when it first occurred to me that the clans
must have visited Barbary. It has therefore, at
present, all the greater weight as testimony; so much
so, indeed, as to induce me to advance a new theory
as to the derivation of the Scots, who, towards the
period of the Roman conquest, reached Ireland, and
finally settled in Scotland. In tracing that people
to Barbary, a new field of peregrinations is opened,
and in pursuing it either up to that point, or subsequently
from that point, we must be satisfied of
their presence and sojourn here. This monument
would give that assurance, were it not for two explanations
that have been offered, either of which
would deprive it of value as an historic record.</p>

<p>Rude stones, it is said, are the first beginnings of
architecture: those called Druidical, need not be
referred to any particular people, and cannot, when
found, be adduced to prove the presence of the
Celts.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_257"></a><a href="#footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>The simple answer is, that Druidical remains have
as decided a character as Egyptian; and as to the
argument<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_258"></a><a href="#footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a></span>
that they are found in Asia and Africa,
where the Celts never have been, history teems
with evidence of their presence in those very places.
Had the cromlechs and Druidical circles belonged
to the original races of Africa, they would surely be
found in more than two parts of its surface.</p>

<p>The other explanation is not so easily disposed of,
as it involves no less intricate a question than the
ancient peopling of the peninsula. It is, that Spain
and the West were inhabited by Celts.</p>

<p>Three theories have been advanced respecting the
early races of Spain. First, that it was colonized
from Judæa. This was founded on the names of men
and places,—the Hebrew roots in the Spanish, and
tradition,—and is sustained by Mariana, Florez, Capmany,
Alderete, &amp;c., also by Scaliger and Bochart,
Selden and Gesenius. It has been exploded by modern
criticism; or it has been admitted, by <em>identifying the
Hebrew and
Celtic</em>.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_259"></a><a href="#footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>The theory which now seems to prevail is, that
the Iberi were Celts.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_260"></a><a href="#footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>The third is a jumble rather than a theory, resulting
from the ethnographical generalization at present in
vogue. It seems to point to the Basques as being
the same people as the ancient
Iberians.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_261"></a><a href="#footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>Ethnography, that very hypothetical science and
suspicious word, deals chiefly, if not exclusively, with
language—not its metaphysical, but its mechanical
part—and as the end and means of science are order,
the human race is methodized into genera, and distributed
into species, as if minerals or plants were
dealt with, so that out of the very speech of man
proceeds this classification, which disposes of him as
of the dumb beasts of the field, and fishes of the
sea. The feat of reducing the populations of Europe,
Celts, Slavs, Basques, and Goths, to one denomination,
has been accomplished just at the time that a
hitherto unheard-of hatred and repulsion has been
engendered between races, threatening society with
convulsions as lamentable in their results as in their
causes. They are fantastic and absurd, and the age
most versed in the knowledge of the events of other
times, exhibits itself as the least capable of any that
has ever existed, for managing the affairs of its own.</p>

<p>In all other investigations of a similar description,
the point of departure is <em>a known language</em>; here it
is an <em>assumed</em> one, just as if, at a future time, out
of some remnants of English, preserved in Yorkshire,
and some Celtic names in Wales, a British language
were to be constructed.</p>

<p>The same fallacy has equally pervaded the three
theories. The assertors of the several origins have
each commenced by assuming <em>one people</em>. Each has
indubitable proofs in hand, as to the existence of
his people, but each will extirpate the others, and
so present vulnerable points to his antagonist.</p>

<p>Larramendi sees nothing in Spain that is not Basque;
Risco nothing that is not Celtic; Mariana nothing
that is not Hebrew; and each is justly ridiculous in
the eyes of his opponent.</p>

<p>In the opening of any field, whether of modern
discovery or of ancient research, we commence by
assuming as many people as we find names, and
only on proof do we admit that two or more belong
to one tribe or race. Proceeding by this simple
method, and applying to Spain the rule undeviatingly
adopted everywhere else, the ancient population will
present no difficulty. We hear of <i>Hispani</i>, of <i>Iberi</i>,
of <i>Keltoi</i>; unquestionably, then, there were three
races distinct in their tongue, time, and habitation.
Each of the theories would annihilate two of these to
establish the third. As soon as we accept the <em>names
handed down</em>, the theories fall to the ground.</p>

<p>I commence, therefore, by denying the authority in
this case of “Philology,” “Sprachenkunde,”
“Glottology,”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_262"></a><a href="#footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></span>
or whatever other name the science may rejoice
in; and notwithstanding the contempt to which I may
thereby be exposed,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_263"></a><a href="#footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></span>
I cannot put aside Herodotus
and Strabo, Cæsar and Pliny. Persisting in the old
notions, I cannot see, in the Iberi, Asiatic-Europeans,
or Indo-Germans. I must hold the <i>Gauls</i> to be Gauls
and the <i>Basques</i> Basques, as I should if there never
had been a Babel of bricks or a Babel of philologists—if
there were still but one tongue for man, as
but one bark and one bray for the dog and the
ass, and Iberian, Celt, and Basque, preserved in
common the tongue of Edom as they do the limbs
of Adam.</p>

<p>The conclusions which I hope to be able to establish
are, that the original inhabitants of Spain were
the Hispani, that the next in date were the Iberi, who
entering not as an irruption but peaceably, came from
the south, and by sea, and spread themselves through
the western and southern region; finally, that the
Celts made their appearance there, also, and that, like
their predecessors, they were neither invaders nor
conquerors: that as the Iberi won their way by commerce
and cultivation, so did the Celts by arms and
discipline—not used against the Iberi and Hispani—but
for their protection against the dreaded encroachments
of the Carthaginians, Romans, and Gauls, beyond
the Pyrenees: that these tribes were sojourners
only, entering Spain by the south and departing from
the north: that the Hispani are preserved in the
existing Basques; that the Iberi belonged to the colonising
races of Canaan, and that the Celts were the
forefathers of the clans who at present dwell in the
Highlands of Scotland.</p>

<p>Ancient as are the people which inhabit Brittany,
Wales, Ireland, and the Highlands, they are modern
when compared with those settled in the north of
Spain. Whence the former came we know—the course
they followed we can trace. But the Basques are like
a plant found on some single hill—its solitariness
gives to it its interest, and we call it indigenous.
Such are the pretensions of this people. They are
the only people in Europe who claim to be autochthonic.</p>

<p>That a people not settled on a remote island or
in a far oasis, but in the midst of us—in the country
which has ever been the battle-field of Europe—should
preserve a tradition which belongs to times anterior
to history, is a fact calculated to instruct as well as
to astonish. The Basques have lived through the mythology
of Greece, the wars of Carthage, the dominion
of Rome, the devastations of the Vandals, the sway
of the Goths, the arms of the Moors, the usurpations
of Madrid, and the opinions of Europe, keeping themselves
all the while distinct, and recollecting themselves
alone. It is impossible to present stronger
titles to priority of occupancy.</p>

<p>Nor is this retentiveness of tradition exceptional in
their character: they have preserved their laws, nay,
more, they have maintained their
rights.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_264"></a><a href="#footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></span> While the
other people of Europe clamour for change and untried
experiment, or, at best, seek to recover a lost
or abandoned privilege, they alone hold to what they
possess; and who can say that what they have got
they did not already possess while the pyramids were
building, and before the laws of Tages were proclaimed
or the Vedas composed, and what they possess
is what they have kept immutable from the
beginning? Why should not a Basque peasant tell
us what happened in the olden time, before Homer
or Orpheus sang, when they exhibit to us in their
daily life how primeval communities lived?</p>

<p>Nor has their gratitude been less long-lived than
their freedom, or their memory shorter for favours
than pretensions. They acknowledge to-day as benefactors
the descendants of strangers, whose fathers
two thousand years ago aided them in their struggle
with Rome.</p>

<p>But traditions and rights do not stand alone. They
have a language—one which has defied every attempt
to classify it, and which persists in utterly denying
all acquaintance with Indo-Celtic or Syro-Phœnician.
It has nothing in common with the languages which,
migrating westward, have passed to the north of the
Caucasus, nor with the Semitic and Japhetic tongues,
that have spread through the maritime regions of
Europe and over the Western districts of Africa. It
is no mosaic work, made out of the wreck of former
tongues; and, Titanic-like, it disdains Greece and her
gods, Phœnicia and her myths.</p>

<p>The Basque language bears intrinsic evidence of
having passed through the Greek and Roman period
wholly uninfluenced by them either in structure or
in terms. And by its structure, its terms, its numeration
and calendar, it ascends as high as it is possible
for any language to ascend: it is as primitive
as any of the tongues of the Indian Archipelago;
it expresses the same astronomical conclusions as
Sabæism; and while in richness of vocables it has
not to fear a comparison with any of those languages
which have not borrowed from others in constructiveness,
in the causal power of the verb it excels in
their various excellences the Hebrew, Russian, and
Turkish. The Basques say that Adam spoke Basque
in Paradise; from which it appears that they imagine
that the excellence of a language is a proof of its
antiquity.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_265"></a><a href="#footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>That there existed an aboriginal population prior
to the emigrations from Canaan, both in Spain and
along the coasts of Africa, is to be inferred from what
we know of Italy, which the Etruscans found well-peopled.
The most remarkable feature of their first
colonization was the drainage of lands, and other
works and arts, which would appear to belong to old
states and periods of redundant population.</p>

<p>The traditions which antiquity itself listened to
and recorded, are everywhere of an anterior and
abundant population, occupying the Peninsulas and
Islands of the Mediterranean. Whether Umbri and
Itali, Spani and Siculi, Osca and
Escara,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_266"></a><a href="#footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></span> be from
one source or not, it was never doubted that Sicily,
Italy, and Spain had received their original population
the one from the
other,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_267"></a><a href="#footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a></span>
before the arrival of
Pelasgi, Etruscans, or Phœnicians. This was believed
two thousand years ago, and was equally reported by
the colonists and by the remnants of the original
people. Nor were these people rude and savage:
witness the Latian polity, the Samnite state, the
two thousand towers of Sardinia, the still existing
Fueros of the Basque. The Noraghi, and the “Sepulchres
of the Giants,” in Sardinia, are no less distinct
from any known architecture than is the Biscayan
from any known tongue.</p>

<p>That the Basques were a great people is proved
by their names being spread all over the Peninsula,
even to the sea-board or limit, which in the Basque
furnishes the etymon of the word, 
<span class="place">Spain</span>.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_268"></a><a href="#footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a></span> That
they inherited the southern shores and were a seafaring
people, is proved by the <em>asserted</em> colonization
of Sicily: that they retroceded—that they abandoned
the Southern country and the coasts; that
they withdrew in the direction of the strong and
remote country, is indubitable—and such is the case
with every original population encroached upon. It
has happened to the Britons, the Welsh, and the Highlanders.
This second wave of population did not
burst over the Alps; it was not a horde or a conquest;
it came from the sea and the south; it could only
be Phœnician or Aramean; its name was Iber—Hebrew.
It gave to the <em>south country</em> the name of
Iberia,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_269"></a><a href="#footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a></span>
which name long afterwards was made general
for Spain by the Romans. Along the two great
rivers they strewed the arts of irrigation and canalization,
originally derived from the plains of Mesopotamia,
and equally practised by the
Etruscans<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_270"></a><a href="#footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a></span> in
Italy. These rivers they named, the one <span class="place">Iber</span>—in
Italy there was the
<span class="place">Tiber</span><span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_271"></a><a href="#footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a></span>—to the other they
gave the name of the law-giver of the Etruscans,
<i>Tages</i>, who might be the common and Eastern ancestor
of both people.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_272"></a><a href="#footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>We have in Spain the Volsci, the Cæretani, Cære,
Suessa, Ausa, Urgel (Virgil), Roma, Alba, &amp;c. We have
the proper names, Andubal, Tagus, Hamilce, Isbal,
Caras, Indebal, Lucius, Baal, Telongus, &amp;c. These
identify not merely the tongue of the Iberians with
that of the maritime colonists of the Mediterranean,
but the colonies themselves, with those of Etruria,
and separate them entirely from the Northern people,
whose language subsists, and affords us the opportunity
of comparison.</p>

<p>The Iberi had so identified themselves with the
Romans, that the Latin became the common tongue.
Already in Cæsar’s time he addressed them in Latin—that
is, without interpreters—as he mentions when
speaking of Gaul. They called the Latin “Lingua
Paterna.” A Spaniard, Antony-Julian, first opened a
school of rhetoric in Rome: he was a rustic who had
tilled the glebe; he never changed his costume or
manners, and disdained to discourse in a walled apartment.
His successor was Quinctilian, also a Spaniard.
Possibly, “had it not been for the invasion of the
Goths and Moors, Latin would now be the speech of
the Spaniards (Iberians), as it was of the Romans in
the time of Tully.” In the Arab times the struggle
was not between the Gothic, but the Latin and the
Arabic. “<cite>Eheu!</cite>” exclaims the Gothic Alvarus, or
Alaric of Cordova, “<cite lang="la">Latini linguam propriam ignorant</cite>.”</p>

<p>Sicilians, Africans, Greeks, and the whole people of
the East, preserved their own tongue; the Spaniards,
who made resistance above all others, alone adopted
that of Rome. Does not this confirm the inference,
which is inevitable from the names of Etruscan colonies
in Spain, that the Iberi and the people of
Latium were of the same race? Thus also do we find
the Latian rights conferred on cities in Spain, while
no such favour was accorded to Sicily or Greece, to
Macedon or Britain. It may be traced wherever the
Etruscan colonies extended.</p>

<p>If, then, the Basque has survived, it is because
there were two languages in Spain, and spoken
by people whose character was as different as their
tongues.</p>

<p>The Basques still retain a method of culture which
is neither the plough nor the spade. An instrument
like a prong is used, each of the labourers having
two: they work in gangs, and turn over the soil with
one-half the labour that is requisite for spade culture.
These prongs are called <dfn>laias</dfn>;—they are as peculiar
to the people as their tongue.</p>

<p>I have elsewhere pointed out the distinction between
the two races in respect to the use of butter,
and the names connected with the dairy; the use of
tapia for building, and the ancient armour. In these
matters of the first importance—agriculture, food,
building, and warfare—there is a clear line drawn
between the Hispani and Iberi.</p>

<p>The Greeks and the Romans were not philologists,
neither were they ethnographists. In no classical
writer is the consanguinity of the Iberians and Numidians
asserted. We have to come down to the
Fathers of the Church to learn, <em>by statement</em>, that the
Hebrew and Phœnician, that these and the Arabic
were sister-tongues. When the Romans became acquainted
with Spain, a period of time had elapsed
from the first settlement of the Iberians, equal to that
from Alfred to our days, and the Basques or Eskora
had been cooped up in the north-east. It is the least
likely of all things that they should have been noticed
by the Romans as a distinct, or have been suspected
to be an original people. Nor can we wonder at
such an oversight at that time, when the same thing
has occurred in modern Spain. Learned men have
been writing profound disquisitions on the origin of
the Spanish language, and compiling lexicons and
etymologies without the slightest reference to the
existing people of Biscay.</p>

<p>The same thing may be said of St. Isidore, Antonio
De Nabrissa, P. Guadix, Diego de Urrea, &amp;c. A
stranger a century ago would have found in the philologists
of modern Spain no more notice of the existence
of the Basque, than of the Chinese language,
although at the same time the Basque writers were
enumerating nearly two thousand Basque words in
the Spanish dictionary.</p>

<p>The strangeness of Iberian words to Roman ears
confirms this view. Volsci, Suessa, Cere, Roma could
not be strange to them. It could only be <em>some</em> of the
names that were so—that is, the names of
places<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_273"></a><a href="#footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a></span>
that had remained from the early occupation of the
Basques.</p>

<p>To us, Hispani and Iberi, Hispania and Iberia, mean
the same thing. They belong to two people, and are
terms of a different order: the one is the name of a
country applied to a people, the other the patronymic
of a tribe applied to a country. You have in Africa
the name Garb in general use for the country, and for
the people Moslemin. No other words are known
there, and our terms for their country would be as
unintelligible to them as theirs are to us. Now suppose
that a conqueror occupied Morocco, ignorant and
contemptuous of foreign tongues: hearing “Garb,”
and “Moslemin,” he would, adding his own termination,
take these words as the general names for the
country, and we should have Morocco called “Garbia”
or “Mosleminia” (to make the analogy complete we
must suppose Moslemin to apply to a tribe, not to a
faith). If then, after fifteen centuries, and when the
people had undergone great vicissitudes, philosophers
should arise to investigate, they might be nonplused
by these two fictitious terms, and could not possibly
see their way until they had discovered that Garb
was a geographical, and Moslemin a tribe name, and
that the ignorant conquerors had not only mistaken
the value of these terms, but had made each general,
and had simultaneously employed both. One nation
may govern another as well under a wrong as a right
name, and, perhaps, much better; but it does not follow
that a philologist will indifferently well theorize
under the like mistake. Now, what I have supposed
is exactly what has happened. A sentence of Strabo
tells the whole story:—</p>

<p>“The <em>Spaniards</em> restrict the name of <span class="place">Iberia</span> to the
part within the Iber; the Romans call the whole
country <span class="place">Iberia</span>, dividing it into hither and thither
<span class="place">Spain</span>,” which is equivalent to calling Great Britain
“Scotland,” and then dividing it into “England on
this and on that side the
Tweed.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_274"></a><a href="#footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>Having thus ascertained the existence of Hispani
and Iberi, the Celts present no difficulty,—they are
neither the one nor the other; and if it were requisite
to establish still more distinctly the originality of
the Iberians, we might do so by citing the contrast
between them and the Gauls, which ancient writers
have left us. Yet, in the present times, the opinion
prevails that the ancient Spaniards were Celts. Of
the two people, contemporaneous portraits have been
sketched by different hands at various periods. They
represent two people wholly different;—there is not
one line of the picture of the one applicable to the other.</p>

<p>The Iberi were a quiet inoffensive race; the Gauls
a warlike and a restless people. The Iberi began to
feel their strength “only after they were subjugated;”
the Gauls were subjugated in consequence of their
overweening confidence in their own strength. The
Iberi gave weapons to the Romans; the Gauls learned
from the Romans the art of war. The Iberi had
short, well-tempered swords which they used with
remarkable agility; the Gauls, long, unwieldy swords,
which turned and bent with their own blow.</p>

<p>The Gauls had their Druids. The Iberian temples—those
of Hercules—were venerable structures when the
Carthaginians approached the walls of Saguntum, the
Romans those of Numantia. The Gauls and Iberians
acknowledged no kindred with each other. The Gauls
claimed no blood-relationship, like the Iberians, with
Rome or Carthage. The Gauls were never called
Iberians, nor the Iberians Gauls; and the Romans,
familiar as they were with the Gauls in Italy, when
they first invaded Spain, would certainly have called
its inhabitants by that name had they belonged to
that race. If the Iberians had been Celts, there would
be Druidical remains, and some record of the last
stand of the Druids, as in England and Gaul.</p>

<p>At the period of the foundation of Rome, the word
Gaul might be considered synonymous with European.
The Gauls had flowed from the eastward like an inundation;
the middle regions of Europe, which they
filled, became insufficient for them; they passed into
Britain; they descended upon Greece; and they
crossed the Bosphorus. Their adventurous spirit
was not arrested by the Alps, nor their courage
daunted by the martial bearing and concentrated
power of the lordly people who then flourished in
the peninsula. They were not, however, able to
overrun Italy, though they colonized many parts, remaining
a distinct people. They never crossed the
Pyrenees; the Vascones and Aquitani spread even in
advance of that barrier far into
Gaul.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_275"></a><a href="#footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a></span> The Gallic
emigration was arrested there by those already in
possession, whether Hispani or Iberi, who were able,
by the confession of the Romans, to contend with
them after the fall of Carthage for the mastery of
the world.</p>

<p>But the name of the Gauls is found in the Peninsula.
Is not this conclusive as to the community of
the races? By no means; it only proves that there
were Celts in Spain. The word is Celt-Iberi—the
Celts and the
Iberi.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_276"></a><a href="#footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a></span>
The compound term marks <em>two
people</em>, just as Medo-Persian, Tyrreno-Pelasgi. Besides,
the people mixed with the Iberi were <i>Celts</i>
(<ins title="Keltoi" lang="el">Κελτοὶ</ins>) not
Galli,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_277"></a><a href="#footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a></span>
as they would have been called
had they crossed the Pyrenees as they did the Alps.
The Celts of Spain must, then, have come across the
sea.</p>

<p>The two southern peninsulas of Europe were anciently
known by the same name. They are the only
regions of the south that resemble each other. They
both have the same form, stretch in the same direction,
adjoin the same continent, lie on the same internal
sea, spread in the same latitude. Both are shut
to the north by a barrier of rocks, and lined on the
Mediterranean shore by a chain of harbours. They
bear the same fruits and grow the same grain. They
have been within the range of the same migrations
and subject to the like vicissitudes. Their mythology
and traditions are interwoven; they had the
same gods, the same founders, the same heroes.</p>

<p>In Italy, we have three distinct waves of early
population—the first the Itali, the second the Tyrseni,
the third the Galli. Shall we not look for
them in Spain? We have them there, Hispani, Iberi,
and Celts, and thus will be accounted for the threefold
affinities which connect Spain, not with Italy
only, but with the whole of the coasts of the Mediterranean,
and even the shores of the Propontis and the
Euxine—the Hispani with Siculi, Itali, Osci, and,
perhaps, with the people of Thrace; the Iberi with
Etruscans, Lydians, Phrygians, Brebers, and Jews;
the Celts with the Gauls of Gaul and Italy, and the
roving Galatai and Keltoi of Asia-Minor, Syria, and
Africa. This difference, however, must be borne in
mind. The Gauls in Italy were invaders; in Spain
they were not, but on the contrary, allies of the natives
against the foreign invasion which always threatened
them from the first irruption of the Gauls to the
final pacification under Augustus.</p>

<p>These affinities have, in modern works, been generalized
and applied to one people or another according
to the theory of philologist or ethnographist. The
confusion arising out of the habit of observing facts
through the medium of systems has been then transferred
back to ancient writers, who, without being
analytical, are correct, and, without being systematic,
intelligible.</p>

<p>Having now proved that Spain was not Celtic,
the Druidical circle at Tangier becomes an evidence
of the presence there of a body of Celts of considerable
importance, and while indicating the point of
entrance of those Celts who had not crossed the Pyrenees,
will serve, also, as a landmark to trace the
wandering of the Highland clans.</p>

<p class="p2 allsmcap center">NOTE ON W. VON HUMBOLDT’S WORK ON THE BASQUES.</p>

<p>The preceding pages were written before I had an
opportunity of consulting W. Von Humboldt’s work.
The title is, “Test of the Inquiries respecting the
Aboriginal Inhabitants of Spain, by means of the
Basque Tongue.” The points which, judging by the
references to it in other writers, are assumed or established
by it, are, that the present Basques are the
ancient inhabitants of Spain, and that these ancient
inhabitants were the Iberi. I consequently opened
it with extreme curiosity, to find by what arrangement
of data, or what sophistry of argument, he could
arrive at such a conclusion. Great was my surprise
to find no conclusion whatever arrived at, and extreme
care taken to avoid appearing to express an
opinion. He has not perceived the distinction between
Hispani and Iberi; and had it been pointed
out to him, he would necessarily have hailed it as a
light which cleared all doubts away:—he has not seen
it himself, because he has started from the assumption
that the Iberians were <em>the</em> ancient people, and,
consequently, every reference to, or mention of, Hispani
was taken as applying to them; and the only
question, as regards distinction of race, arises with the
Celts, viz., whether they were the same as the Gauls,
and in what they differed from or resembled the Iberi
<em>or</em> Hispani? All he says is interesting; there is
nothing which controverts the view opened out in the
foregoing pages, and much that adds strength to it.</p>

<p>Starting from the point above-mentioned, he proceeds
to find, for every name recorded in ancient
writers, a word in Basque by which to explain it.
When the name is nearly Celtic, Roman, or Carthaginian,
or quite so, he drops it. By such a process the
names of any and every country may be made to belong
to any and every other.</p>

<p>M. Von Humboldt having expressed his own inability
to decide, earnestly invites the investigation of
the learned, and he suggests to them a thread by
which they may advance securely through the imagined
labyrinth;—this is no other than the study of
coins. As well might he have suggested the investigation
of Assyrian antiquities by the books printed
at Babylon and
Nineveh.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_278"></a><a href="#footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></span></p>

 Humboldt (“Prüfung,”&amp;c., sections 41, 43, 44), admits a great
contrast between the Celts and the Gauls, and not that difference
between them and the tribes of the Peninsula, which might be
expected from people of different origin. The union he supposes
must have been of great antiquity, and could not have
taken place by violence. He is not clear that we can call the
Celts Gauls at all, and yet he imagines that there must have
been emigrations from Gaul; then he supposes them mixed
autochthonically with the Iberi, and afterwards pressed together
by foreigners occupying the coasts.</p>

<p class="footnote">Astorloa (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 199), denies this mixture of Celts and Iberians,
and explains away the word: if Celts had crossed into the
Peninsula, they would have been settled, he imagines, close to

<h4 class="h4head"><span class="allsmcap">THE CLANS IN BARBARY.</span></h4>

<p class="center" lang="la">“Scoti per diversa
vagantes.”—<span class="smcap"><abbr title="Ammianus">Am.</abbr> Marcellinus.</span></p>

<p class="p2">From things which only a Highlander could have
observed, I learned that my forefathers had visited
Barbary. I perceived the intercourse of the two people
in their baking and cooking, dairy, dress, ornaments,
superstition and words. If this connexion were with
the Celts in general, it would be a matter of mere
ethnography, but it is one of history, for the coincidences
are with the clans alone.</p>

<p>The kirtle, plaid, bonnet, eagle’s plume, family
cognisances are unknown in Brittany; nor do the
Bretons call their farm-steads, <dfn>gabhail</dfn>, or their greyhounds,
<dfn>sloghie</dfn>. The dress of the clans is not that
of the ancient Gauls: those who advocate its antiquity
are much puzzled to find a source for it,
and content themselves with supposing it to be
derived from the Roman. No supposition can be
more groundless: that branch of the Celts which never
did submit to Roman domination could not be the
only one to adopt the Roman
dress.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_279"></a><a href="#footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a></span> The Scots,
during the period of Roman power in Britain, never
came in contact with them, and under the empire,
the Toga itself had been laid aside; at least,
corpses<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_280"></a><a href="#footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a></span>
and statues only wore it.</p>

<p>The costume of the Highlands, then, carries us back
beyond Roman times, and beyond all written record;
it alone remains in Europe, a monument of this
order,—that of Barbary alone remains among a
people derived from the East. I have already shown
that they are the same; which carries both back to
the plains of Mesopotamia, or the banks of Jordan.</p>

<p>Mr. Layard’s researches above, as well as under
ground, have furnished further evidence in many
points of resemblance between their manners and the
scenes carved on the alabasters of the Assyrians, and
the customs preserved by the mountain-tribes in the
neighbourhood.</p>

<p>The clans crowned their king on a stone, and
threw down their plaids before him. One full statue
only has been found at Nimroud: it is that of a king,
and he is seated on a square
stone:<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_281"></a><a href="#footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a></span> doubtless the
Assyrians threw down their mantles before him.</p>

<p>The eagle’s plume is worn in the bonnet by the
Tigari.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_282"></a><a href="#footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a></span>
The King at Nimroud wears a cap standing
up in front like the Scotch bonnet; the straps
and ribbons flow behind.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_283"></a><a href="#footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>In several bas-reliefs, the kilt appears, and is
pointed out by Mr. Layard:<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_284"></a><a href="#footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a></span>
the mountaineers wear
a long shirt dyed of one colour, as was formerly
used among the clans.</p>

<p>The chief and impregnable fortress of the Kurds
is called the “Castle of the
Cymri,”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_285"></a><a href="#footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a></span> and, as if to
return the compliment, the Celts have given the
name Carne <em>serai</em>,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_286"></a><a href="#footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a></span>
to the place in Argyleshire,
where, on a sculpture of the thirteenth century, the
long plaids (philemore)<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_287"></a><a href="#footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></span>
with the double-folds, may
be seen, exactly as they are worn by the Jewish
women in Morocco.</p>

<p>In Nineveh there was no bath. The mountain-tribes
indulge, in all ways and in all places, in washing and
dabbling in water, without the slightest regard to
the sense of delicacy which is so strong in all other
Eastern people. The clans were formerly remarkable
in like manner for the use of water;—new-born
infants were plunged in cold
water.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_288"></a><a href="#footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>The clan system hinges on the distinction of the
different families by “sets” of colours. In this they
differ from all the people of the West, who have
colours in a flag, and not on their persons. The
Yezidis, called the worshippers of the devil, have in
like manner their colours, black and
red,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_289"></a><a href="#footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a></span> which they
wear, and with which they adorn their habitations.
The clans passing through these countries, and engaged
in the wars (as I shall presently show they
were), of necessity must have also so distinguished
themselves; and being neither a horde migrating, nor
a nation in possession, but serving as mercenaries
under distinct leaders, each of these would adopt
distinguishing badges, and thence the “sets” and
tartans of the different clans, and the common name
adopted by them.</p>

<p>The discoveries of Nineveh, and the modes of
dyeing among the population which still lives in the
neighbourhood of those ruins, confirm to the letter
what I have said elsewhere respecting the selection
of a standard of colour, and the preservation of it in
the tartan.</p>

<p>The tartan existed only by the art of dyeing:
without perfection in it, the idea of distinction by
colours could not be entertained. This was not a
mere difference between black and white, as the <em>ak</em>
and <em>cara coïnjolou</em>, or white and black fleeces of the
Turks, which was obtained by natural wool; nor was
it the colour of a cap or a slipper which might be
purchased ready dyed: proficiency in one colour did
not suffice, but in all. They had to be dyed in every
cottage, or under every tent. They were applied to
the coarsest substances, for the rudest wear, and to
be recognizable so long as the material held together.
This was to be achieved by a migratory and erratic
people, in times when no lac or indigo, no chromates
or phosphates were to be found at every apothecary’s.
The dyes were to be sought in the fields or on the
mountain sides;<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_290"></a><a href="#footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a></span>
and each emigration involved a
new series of experiments, to be rewarded by new
triumphs of unaided industry and untutored taste.
How deeply planted in their natures must have been
the instinct of colours, thus to preserve those tints
in daily wear, which at Nineveh have been saved
by being buried in the bowels of the earth. It was
not the colours most easily obtained that they selected:
they had a rule, to which circumstances were made to
bend.</p>

<p>Brown is the natural colour of a large proportion of
the fleeces; it is dyed with a moss (crottle) by simple
boiling: the colour is beautiful and indelible. They
like brown as a common wear: shepherd’s coats,
plaids, and trowsers, are made of it, but never was
brown seen in a Tartan! The clans learnt this art
where they had occasion to adopt the badge.</p>

<p>“Dyes of the finest quality, particularly reds and
greens, which even European ingenuity has been
unable to equal, are obtained by the inhabitants
of Kurdistan from flowers and herbs, growing abundantly
in their mountains. The art of extracting
them is not a recent discovery, but has been known
for ages to people living in the same country; as we
learn from the frequent mention of Babylonian and
Parthian dyes by ancient authors. The carpets of,
Kurdistan and Persia are still unrivalled, not only
for the beauty of their texture, but for the brilliancy
of their hues. From the ornaments on the
dresses of the figures in the Assyrian sculptures, we
may conclude, that similar colours were extensively
used, either in dyeing the garments themselves, or
the threads with which the material was
woven.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_291"></a><a href="#footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>On asking a gentleman well acquainted with these
countries,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_292"></a><a href="#footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a></span>
if he perceived any resemblance between
their customs, and those of the Highlanders, his
answer was, “It strikes every one, especially in
respect to their chiefs and clan government: The different
tribes may also be known by the stripes of
colour on the shalvar, as the Highland clans by
the stripes on their tartan; and they have the tradition,
that Europe is peopled by tribes that emigrated
from their country.”</p>

<p>My informant connected this tradition with the
recognised Eastern origin of the people of Europe, but
it cannot refer to these emigrations. That the Celts
came from the East all history attests, and philology
has confirmed its
verdict;<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_293"></a><a href="#footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a></span>
but the waves of emigration
which flowed westward passed all to the northward
of the Caspian Sea. A physical necessity determined
their course; and from the Himalaya to the
Carpathian Seas deserts or mountain barriers extend,
which prevented their overflowing the south, and set
them on Europe. The Turks are an exception, being
enabled to cross the desert regions between the Sea of
Aral and the Hindoo Cush by means of their horses,
and their pastoral habits. To the southward, therefore,
of this line no tradition of this peopling of
Europe could subsist; and I might have set this one
aside, as some uncertain reverberation of the great
Celtic, Teutonic, and Slavonic emigrations, had I not
recollected the name which the Jews of Morocco apply
to Europe—“<cite>Erse dom</cite>.” They then were acquainted
with the “Erse,”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_294"></a><a href="#footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a></span>
or Gaelic tribes, and must have
known them to have gone to Europe, and called it by
their name. This explained at once how the Koords
should have a similar recollection of the peopling of
Europe by tribes who emigrated from their country.</p>

<p>Many coincidences might be added to these. For
instance, among the Irish Scots a higher class of
Druids, unknown among the British, was called <dfn>Ollama</dfn>,
evidently the “Ulema”—the learned—of the East.
The name of fairies in Erse is <dfn>shechyan</dfn>, the Arab <dfn>sheik</dfn>.
Moore remarks, that these beings seem to record some
lost class or people, which he supposes to be the
Druids. The blood-fine was, for a prince, a thousand
oxen; in Arabia it is a thousand camels. It was
commuted in the Highlands for a coin, which is designated
by the Spanish word <dfn>oros</dfn>. The soldier’s allowance
in the East is called “tain,” whence <dfn>timariot</dfn>, the
feudal tenure of Turkey. A Celtic poem, attributed
to the sixth century, and “claiming respect as exceeding
in antiquity any production of any vernacular
tongue of Europe,”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_295"></a><a href="#footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a></span>
is entitled <cite>Tain Bho</cite>, which is
translated “Spoil of Cattle.”</p>

<p>The Irish Scots are the only people of Europe who
have had their language, not through the Greeks and
Romans, but directly from the first inventors. But I
do not lay any stress on this coincidence, as their
letters probably were—or at least may have been—in
use in Ireland long before the arrival of the clans,
having been taught by the Phœnicians.</p>

<p>The peculiarities which distinguish the clans from
the Celts in general, may thus be traced to the countries
lying upon the Euphrates and the eastern and
southern shores of the Mediterranean. On the other
hand, in Judæa and the coast of Africa, are to be found
cromlechs and Druidical remains, which attest their
passage through these countries. With the inference
thence to be drawn, their own traditions concur.</p>

<p>Great Britain and Ireland were inhabited from the
beginning by Gauls. The Scots, though Gauls, were a
distinct and a military body, and they entered at a subsequent
time from a different direction. We trace
them from Scotland to Ireland, where for a time they
were the dominant race. They had reached Ireland
from Spain: they had not reached Spain, however, from
Gaul but <em>from Barbary</em>,—such were their traditions
when first recorded.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_296"></a><a href="#footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>In Westminster Hall there is a stone on which the
Kings of England are crowned. It was carried thither
from Scone, where the kings of Scotland had been
crowned upon it; and had been placed there by Kenneth,
son of Alpen, after his victory over the Picts in
843. To Scone it had been transported from Dunstaffnage,
where the successors of Fergus had been crowned
upon it. To Dunstaffnage it had been brought from
Tarah,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_297"></a><a href="#footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a></span>
where the Scottish kings of Ireland had been
crowned upon it; and Ireland had been named from it
Innisfail. To Tarah it had been brought from
Spain,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_298"></a><a href="#footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a></span>
and to Spain, it was said, from the Holy
Land.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_299"></a><a href="#footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></span> It
emitted under the rightful prince a sound like that of
the statue of Memnon,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_300"></a><a href="#footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a></span>
and remained dumb under a
usurper. The importance attached to it was such as to
make its removal to England to be considered in the
time of Edward I. a necessary step towards the subjugation
of the Scottish kingdom. They called it the
stone of fortune, and the stone of destiny (Lia fail).<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_301"></a><a href="#footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>Tradition, among the other people of Europe, is an
inventor of fable, rather than a recorder of facts; but
its value is very different among these races. Supposing
that our books were swept away—not one ancient
name could be found in Europe: the Gaul of the
North alone would be able to restore them. He would
tell you the names of the islands of Britain and Ireland
which Aristotle used twenty-three centuries ago—they
know no others,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_302"></a><a href="#footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a></span> therefore are their traditions
valuable.</p>

<p>Although I think I have established my proposition
without the aid of history, I can boldly appeal to it.
Historical works of authority are dramas performed by
some great people, who are ever on the stage and in
front; and events are assorted so as to wind in and
conceal, if not to disguise and suppress, whatever does
not belong to them. In Livy’s pages the earth is a
chess-board, and the players sit in the senates of Rome
and Carthage; but if we go to the sources from which
he drew, and refer to authors who have dealt with
special subjects, we find other actors and other passions.
We then see the honour of one battle transferred
from the devotion of a consul to the docility of
quadrupeds, and the glory of another from legionary
valour to fameless barbarians.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_303"></a><a href="#footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a></span>
Roman history is a conspiracy
to rob of their fame the Elephants and the
Gauls. What were the conditions imposed by Rome—what
the fate incurred by Carthage? the surrender of
her ships, her elephants, and her <em>Gauls</em>. Such was the
importance of tribes which Roman writers exhibit as
warlike, yet undisciplined as brave; but unmanageable,
with long unwieldy swords, and rash and aimless
impulses. Here were they <em>in Africa</em> the prop of <em>Carthage</em>.
They had “learned from long military service
to speak Phœnician,”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_304"></a><a href="#footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a></span>
and yet remained so distinct a
body as to require “interpreters to disclose to the Carthaginians
their decrees.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_305"></a><a href="#footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>Further to the east, a century before, during the
convulsions which followed the death of Alexander,
and preceded the great contest between Carthage and
Rome, the part they played is thus described by Justin:</p>

<p>“So powerful at this time was the race of the Gauls,
that they filled all Asia, as if with a swarm: neither
did the kings of the East carry on any war without a
mercenary army of Gauls; nor when driven from their
throne did they seek refuge elsewhere than amongst the
Gauls. Such was the terror of the Gaelic name—such
the unconquered fortune of their arms, that dominion
was not deemed securely possessed, nor lost greatness
capable of recovery, unless by Gaelic bravery.”</p>

<p>The Gauls are here measured against
Greeks,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_306"></a><a href="#footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a></span> with
the art of war carried to the highest point, and strategy
raised into a science, amongst the general-kings, disputants
for the relics of Alexander’s army and dominion.
Here were Gauls—but how different from those
of Gaul! here were Gauls as thoroughly conversant,
and as essentially imbued with the knowledge of all
the systems of the East and South, as those of the
North were ignorant of all habits foreign to their own.
Here then is the people to furnish the emigration from
the Holy Land to Spain, and to the Highlands, which
their own traditions report: here are the circumstances
to fashion them into that peculiar discipline
which up to this day they have preserved.</p>

<p>According to their own tradition they had crossed
into Spain from Barbary. They were not originally in
Africa; they must then have come all the way round
the Mediterranean, and then must they have derived
their origin from those Celts who, six or seven centuries
before the Christian era, having been repulsed
from Italy and Greece, crossed the Bosphorus and settled
a large kingdom in Asia Minor: such is the account
given of them by the writers of the period. They
wandered through Asia Minor—as the Arabs and Patans
do in India, or the Albanians in Turkey—before they
settled in Galatia, and to this settlement they were
constrained. But probably they did not all so settle
when the Romans conquered that country, and in a
manner waged against them a war of extermination:
their wanderings were resumed, and it must have been
to the South that they directed their steps. Already
were they familiarized with these regions, and probably
entertained a peculiar relationship with the most remarkable
of its people.</p>

<p>“Galilee,” and “Galilee <em>of the Gentiles</em>,” can only
mean a Celtic colony or
settlement.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_307"></a><a href="#footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a></span>
The Gauls are of
as frequent occurrence in Josephus as in Cæsar’s Commentaries.
The “Gentiles” of Galilee were not the
ancient inhabitants, for it was the land of the Gergesenes,
who never could become Jews, as the Galileans
were in the time of Christ. The expression “of
the Gentiles<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_308"></a><a href="#footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a></span>”
must apply to strangers admitted
within the Jewish pale. It was this country that Solomon
had desired to give away, and that Hiram would
not take.</p>

<p>This would be the most likely place for a settlement
of Gauls. The name is given at a period which would
coincide with the hypothesis; nor is there anything
extraordinary in the Galileans being Celts, seeing that
in the time of Jerome the language of <em>Treves</em> was
spoken in nearly its primitive purity in the centre of
Asia Minor.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_309"></a><a href="#footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>The idea which we have formed of the barrier between
the Jews and the Gentiles, arises from the extermination
of, and the constant denunciations against
the nations of Canaan—the Gibeonites alone excepted—an
exception obtained by fraud. There was no obstacle
whatever to the admission of any stranger to full
participation and entire identification with the Jewish
people. Whenever there was an exception it was in
consequence of transactions between that people and
the Jews. The Jew resembled a man whose life is
prolonged some thousand years with a memory unimpaired.
He had been enslaved by the Egyptian—he
was ever after shy of him. (The Egyptian became a
Jew only in the third generation.) Amalek had smote
him on the way of the Desert, and he hated
him.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_310"></a><a href="#footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a></span>
The exceptions were the Canaanite among the children
of Esau, Amalek and the Egyptians: any other
stranger had only to be
circumcised.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_311"></a><a href="#footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a></span> From the time
of the Grecian Conquests, the Jews themselves attempted
to efface this distinction, that they might
appear in the Palestra like the Greeks.</p>

<p>This explains perhaps why Galilee was the chief
field of the labours of Christ, and how his disciples were
principally from that people, who were most untainted
by the prevailing superstitions, not ranked amongst
Jewish schisms, and free from the servile imitation of
the Greeks. Thus may we claim for our race a share
in the first fishing for men; and it is not an extravagant
stretch of the imagination to picture the listeners
to “the Sermon on the Mount,” decked with the
eagle’s plumes and girded with the sporran and
dirk.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_312"></a><a href="#footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a></span></p>

<p>The sagacious Ptolemies gathered from Syria all
the scattered elements of strength: they turned elephants
to account: they collected Jews and attracted
them into Egypt—they could not have neglected the
Gauls. In common with the Jews, they must have
suffered in the convulsions of Egypt, and those who
abandoned Egypt left it always for the West. Down
that slope of the Barbary shore—like so many other
races—they must have slid, and, arriving at the bourne
of the wandering Arab, they too raised their pillar
opposite the stones which Hercules placed. This
stone no local tradition consecrates, no ancient belief
confirms, no contemporary monument explains, no
people claims. It is their own. The Arab, as he
tents beside it, calls it a “<dfn>peg</dfn>,” and on it hangs
the history of the Highland clans. Arrested by the
ocean—like the Saracens a thousand years later—they
turned to the North, and crossing the Straits, got
back again to Europe.</p>

<p>Thus, by the aid of history and monuments have
we brought them down to Spain, up to which their
own traditions had carried them. They appeared in
Spain to continue that contest with Rome which the
exterminations of Galatia had commenced, and their
breasts might have been animated by the remembrance
even of Brennus and the capitol. At last, after
all the world had been subjugated by the final conquest
of the Asturians and the Vascones, they took ship to
seek new settlements. Gauls were in great numbers
in Asia, Syria, Africa, and Spain: no trace of them is
to be found in the present day, nor any record of them
after the first centuries of the Christian era downwards:
they were not a people to become confounded with
the native populations: they passed, then, out of these
regions. Let us see if Spain preserves any record of the
event.</p>

<p>To this day the Irish and Scotch are entitled, on
setting foot in Biscay, to every privilege and immunity
of the natives;—they have the rank of nobles, can be
elected to any magistracy, and have the right of holding
land. From these privileges Spaniards are excluded.
In the whole range of history no more interesting record
will be found of the friendship of two races divided
by 2000 years. This isopolitan league, recorded in
the institutions of Biscay, is a monument of the passage
through Spain, of our mountain clans, not less remarkable
than the Usted of Tangier; and we may be
as certain of the event as if the day of departure
and the numbers of the
vessels<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_313"></a><a href="#footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a></span>
had been chiselled on
granite or engraven on steel.</p>

<p>Driven from Spain by the advance of the Roman
arms, where should they have taken, or where could
they have sought refuge? Gaul was occupied, America
not open, Africa and Britain were provinces of Rome;
the North of Europe, if not Roman, distant or difficult
of access—there remained only Ireland. The Romans
were in possession of Britain for 400 years; why did
they never set foot in Ireland? They had fleets at their
command; a few vessels collected on the coast had
sufficed to cross to Britain—that coast was difficult.
Ireland invited their approach; they had forces to dispose
of, even for the conquest of barren lands; they
could send 50,000 men to the North, and support the
expedition by sea; they could circumnavigate the
island, push commerce, spread agriculture, pierce forests
with roads, fix on stations, and fortify camps. Ireland
was then green as she is now; wooded as she is no
longer; rich in her produce, refined in her industry.
Science and learning were there; strangers had
settled on her soil, and adventurers from the Holy
Land had, perhaps, for a thousand years exported her
produce and worked her mines. Ireland was then
every way attractive;—no British parliament had yet
passed an Irish law;—why then did not the Romans
cross from the Severn and the Mersey? <em>The Scots
were there.</em></p>

<p>The Roman historians do not mention them; they
were not in Caledonia to meet Agricola or Severus;
their first passage into Scotland coming within the range
of history, occurred only <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 258, and it was centuries
before they established their dominion in the North.—The
“Stone of Fate” accomplished its pilgrimage to
Argyle. A century after their first passage (368), an
incursion into England is the first recorded instance of
collision with the
Romans.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_314"></a><a href="#footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a></span>
And are they not even as
we see them—or at least such as they made themselves
felt but a century ago—a people who must have had
some such history, whose adventurous spirit must have
been disciplined by long peregrinations—the Ulysses of
nations, seeing the cities and observing the manners of
many people, and having an eye to mark what was profitable,
and a hand to hold what they had thought
proper to select? What other people brought a flag
to every breast? in its vestment conferred upon the
humblest the blazon of heraldry, and the insignia of
kings; selecting emblems and signs from the fairest
objects of nature, or the most imaginative inventions
of man: primitive colours, flowers of the field, plume
of the sky? Alone in Europe they retain a stamp, a
memory, and a name. After discomfiting the remnant
of a line of false princes, the British parliament feared
to dwell in the same island with the Kilt, nor deemed
itself secure where the “battle colours” were dyed with
the heather, spun on the soil, and worn by the
clans.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_315"></a><a href="#footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a></span></p>

<p>All that remains is the last flickering of the light of
a land extinguished, not by the blast of battle, but by
the breath of her sons. Had Scotland’s chiefs been true
to the noblest station in Europe, she would have held
her own and saved England.</p>

 Sir G. Wilkinson found a stone in a statue, sonorous, and
that in its top while concealed from below, he could by striking
it produce a sound. Referring to this incident, while
standing beside the Assyrian statue, mentioned a few pages back,
I struck it in illustration of the method used. It instantly
answered in Memnon’s voice, with the clear sound of bell-metal.</p>

 “Their peaceful glens were visited with the scourge of a
licentious soldiery let loose upon the helpless inhabitants, and
every means taken to break up the peculiar organization, and
consequent power of the Highland clans. The disarming act,
which had been passed after the insurrection of the year 1715,
was now carried into rigid execution, and with a view to destroy
as much as possible any distinctive usages of this primeval race
and thus to efface their nationality, an act was passed, proscribing
the use of their ancient garb. The indignity inflicted by
this act was perhaps more keenly felt by the Highlanders, attached
in no ordinary degree to their ancient customs, than any
of the other measures resorted to by the English Government:
but at the same time it must be admitted, that it effected the
object contemplated in its formation, and that more was accomplished
by this measure, in destroying the nationality, and
breaking up the spirit of the clan’s-men, than by any of the
other acts. The system of clanship was also assailed by an act
passed in the year 1748, by which heritable jurisdictions were
abolished throughout Scotland, and thus the sanction of law
was removed from any claim which Highland chiefs, or barons,
might in future be disposed to make upon the obedience or service
of their followers.”—<span class="smcap">Skinner’s</span> <cite>Sketch</cite>,

<h3 class="h3head"><a id="chap5_1"></a>CHAPTER <abbr title="One">I.</abbr></h3>

<h4 class="h4head"><span class="allsmcap">THE ISLAND OF ANDALUZ.</span></h4>

<p class="p2">The emporium of the new world and the port of
the Western ocean, has become an inland town; but
the shade of orange groves, the white marble of Moorish
halls, the dance, the bull-fight, the garb of the
Andalusian, still attract the wanderer and detain the
guest. No where on the soil of Europe is there so
much that is beautiful with so little that is familiar.
The Tower of our metropolis claims the honour of
having for its founder Julius Cæsar. The dictator
appears only in the list of the benefactors of Seville:
pressing forward to the bounds of human memory,
she proudly asserts a founder among the gods. Existing
when Rome was founded, and Carthage built, she
has witnessed their catastrophe and survived their
decay. From the earliest peopling of the earth to
the present hour, Seville has endured a mother, if
not a mistress, city, and has never known sack or
desolation. Italica was the first Roman colony beyond
the Alps—Seville was the capital of the Goths.
Two kings were canonized; the one for its capture,
the other for its defence.</p>

<p>This single provincial city possesses the tradition
of the Phœnicians; traces of the Romans; tombs of
the Goths; monuments of the Saracens; a cathedral
that has no equal. It has the highest tower, the
purest air, the longest plain, and the richest soil in
Spain. It contains the masterpiece of Spanish sculpture,
and a whole school of unrivalled painting. It
may be true of Spain, if of any country, that</p>

<p class="unindent">But, according to the old proverb on the lips of every
peasant, Seville herself is the marvel, and nevertheless,
she is a truly Spanish town—a village, not a
city.</p>

<p>A noble bust stands in the orange grove of the
“House of Pontius Pilate.” It would appear to be an
effort to conjoin the most opposite qualities, and to
represent under one head the distinguishing attributes
of the sexes, strength and daring, voluptuousness and
grace. The head is large, the brow ponderous, the
eye full and grave, while the cheek and lips are
robbed from Hebe. It is hard to say whether the
martyr’s palm, the veil of Cythera, or the club of
Hercules is the emblem befitting it. On inquiring
where it had been discovered, I was surprised to learn
that it was a head of Cleopatra, a present from a
Roman Pontiff. It must have been sent to the Queen
of Guadalquivir, as the prototype of herself; sensual
and heroic, faithful and capricious, wanton and
warlike—handling with equal dexterity and equal
grace, the faggot and the fan; the castanet and
navaja; the champion of the Catholic church against
Arianism, the bulwark of Spain against the Northmen,
the first pupil of the Saracens in art, the first
rebel against their
power;<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_316"></a><a href="#footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a></span>
the competitor of Florence,
Venice, Bologna, and Rome, in design, painting,
and architecture; the mother of the Inquisition;
claiming as her founder the representative of force,
and selecting as her patrons two spotless virgins.
From her port was embarked the gold that in former
ages adorned the temples of idolatry, and on her beach
has been in modern times landed the gold of Mexico
and Peru, that has left Spain bankrupt and Europe
rich in corn and poor in worth.</p>

<p>A Spaniard, in describing her, commences in these
terms: “In the part of Spain towards the South, in
the rich and fertile province of Andalusia, on the
oriental bank of the river Guadalquivir, stands the
beautiful Sevillia, capital and metropolis of four
kingdoms, first court of the Spanish monarchy, and
primacy of the churches of Spain.”</p>

<p>Andalusia to the Moors was the Atlantic Island—the
garden which they found wild, and which they
filled with new plants, flowers, and fruit. “God in
his justice,” said they, “having denied to the Christians
a heavenly paradise, has given them in exchange
an earthly one. It is a garden where the high
places are battle-fields, but whose vales are free from
famine.”</p>

<p>So sang one of those Sevillian poets who were so
numerous that “Africa would not have held them,
if it had been divided out in portions among them,”
and whose praises had such charms that “had they
been bestowed on the Night they would have made
her fairer than the Day.”</p>

<p>The Easterns represent the world as a bird, the
East being the head, Europe the body, the North and
the South the wings, and the West the tail. Haroun-el-Raschid
told an Andalusian that he was from the
world’s tail: the Andalusian replied, “the bird <em>is a
peacock</em>.”</p>

<p>Al-bekir-Al-andalusi thus sums up the excellence
of his native country: “It is equal to Sham (Syria)
for purity of air and sweetness of waters; to Yemen,
for mildness of temperature; to Hind (India), for
drugs and aromatic plants; to China, for mines and
precious stones; to Aden (Arabia), for the number
and security of its coasts and harbours.”</p>

<p>To that stock of knowledge known to us under the
general name of Saracen, Morocco contributed probably
that dexterity in the distribution of water, and
the perfection of agriculture and taste in gardening,
which so enriched and embellished Spain under its
dominion. These arts could not have been furnished
by the Nomade tribes of Arabia Petrea; and they
were to be looked for in the descendants of that
people, who for four centuries had made their country
the granary of Rome and the world, who inherited
the agricultural science, which had aided Carthage to
extend her dominion. The Tribe government of the
Douar, still subsisting, arose amidst patriarchal manners,
and science triumphs without obscuring the charms
of nature, or the taste of man. This country and its
stories are the “Arabian Nights”—not read, but seen.</p>

<p>Ibnir Ghalib entitles one of his chapters, “Contentment
of the soul in contemplating the ruins of
Andalusia.” For us this contemplation suggests any
thing but contentment. The Moor needed no lessons
from the past<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_317"></a><a href="#footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a></span>—the
traces of Carthaginian wealth
and Roman power were useless to him. He required
no maxims, for he cultured no fallacies. The Arabs
united the two systems of the ancient world—the
tribe and colony. The results in public riches and
individual well-being, neither predecessors nor successors
have rivalled or conceived. Such are the
lessons which we may learn in the city of the fandango
and guitar, whither we may have strayed only
to bestow a passing glance to Lydian steps, or a
listening hour to Teian measures.</p>

<p>In regard to Moorish ruins, Seville disappointed
me. The great mosque has been demolished: the
cathedral, indeed, occupies its site, but why should
the other have been destroyed? The Alcazar is by
the Sevillians extolled above the Alhambra; but, excepting
the entrance, it can be admired only as a
copy by those who have seen the works of the master.
Originally it was a Moorish edifice, but it was remodelled
under Spanish kings, and is now undergoing
repairs and painting in the deplorable style of the
specimens of Moorish plaster hung up in the Museum
of Madrid.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_318"></a><a href="#footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a></span>
The term Cazar, or Cazaria, is derived
from the palace of the Cæsars; it was then associated
with the Moorish god, and thus acquired an impress
of grandeur. A petition from a township, imploring
the Queen to take the government out of the
hands of the Cortes, places in antithesis <em>Alcazar</em> and
“<em>club</em>!”</p>

<p>The house of Pontius Pilate pretends to be nothing
more than an imitation; as such it is a splendid work.
Its chief value is, in recording the thought of the
chieftain, who, after his pilgrimage to the Holy Land,
endeavouring to transfer to his native city the type
of Palestine—took the model of a Moorish palace for
the habitation of the Roman governor of Judæa.</p>

<p>Seville has been well chosen by Corneille as the
scene of his “Cid.” This title, and the reasons he
puts in Ferdinand’s mouth for conferring it on the
young hero, show that he looked on the Moors
as models for a soldier and a knight. The character
of the contest is pourtrayed with no less accuracy
than is preserved the simplicity of the ballad. The
Spaniards are inflamed against the Mussulman with
none of the fanatic spirit of the Eastern struggles
and crusading times; yet the feelings which naturally
suggest themselves in a war between Infidels and
Christians, seemed needful for the purpose and the
colouring of his picture.</p>

<p>A street named <span class="place">Calle de la Moreria</span>, or street of
the quarter of the Moors, is the record of the different
treatment of that people by Ferdinand the Saint,<br>
and Ferdinand the Catholic.</p>

<p>“Ferdinand, after the capture of Seville, divided
the quarters of the city among the various nations,
provinces, and tribes:—one called <i>Aduaress</i>, was inhabited
by the Moors, who remained in the city after
the Conquest, or who came from Granada as auxiliaries
to St. Ferdinand. After the Conquest of Granada,
these Moors were obliged to send every year a
certain number, to take part in the honours paid to
St. Ferdinand on the 30th of May; and they had
to assist <em>at the Vigils and Mass</em>, in <dfn>capuzes</dfn>, with
green <dfn>caperotes</dfn>, with their crescents also green, and
they stood round the tumulus with white torches
burning in their hands. The Moreria existed down
to 1502, when, by an order of the Catholic king,
all the Moors, inhabitants of Seville, were expelled
the kingdom, which order and the mode of execution
are sufficiently curious to be published here, as they
have not been given by any author.</p>

<p>“The King and the Queen.—D. Juan di Silva, Count
of Cifuenti, our Alferez Mayor, and of our Council,
and our Assistant for the very noble city of Seville:
We have agreed to order all the Moors to quit our
kingdoms, and we order you, that you cause this
paper (carta) to be published, and that you place
in sequestration the mosques and other common property
of the Moors, and to see that the said mosques
are cleaned and shut up, and therein use the diligence
that we know in you. From the city of Seville,
the twelfth day of the month of February, one
thousand five hundred and two. I, the King. I, the
Queen. By order of the King and the Queen, Miguel
Perez de Almazâ.</p>

<p>“The Conde de Cifuenti, with his lieutenant, the
Licenciado Lorenzo Somero, with the public writer,
Francisco Sigura, repaired on the same day with a
competent number of aguacils to the quarters of the
Moors, and having here assembled and being present
Maestre Mohammed Recocho, Maestre Mohammed Daiena,
and Maestre Mohammed Saganche, and Ali Faza,
and Maestre Alunlie Aguja, and Ali Nuyun—Moors—showed
to them and read the royal order, which
they kissed, and placed upon their heads in sign of
obedience.” They then opened the mosque, and proceeded
to the sequestration, and made oath that
these were the whole of the <i lang="es">bienes communes</i>, by God
the all-powerful Creator of the heaven and the earth.
Then they passed all out of the city, and took possession
of the Æsario, adjoining the field of Santa
Justa. And this was accomplished with such expedition,
that the expulsion is protocoled as completed
on the same day, 15th February,
1502.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_319"></a><a href="#footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the canons of the cathedral remarked,
“Whenever you disturb the ground you come upon
turbans: everywhere do the signs appear of the heads
of the Moors, above as well as below the earth, and
in Andalusia are their hearts still
buried.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_320"></a><a href="#footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a></span> But it
is not in the midst of joyous Seville that the image
of such a contest can be called up: you require ruins
in loneliness—these you have a few miles distant, at
Alcala. There is the stamp of that fierce border war
of many centuries. It is, besides, a perfect study of
military architecture. There may be seen double
tiers of guns, as on the broadside of a ship, the
lower embrasure no wider than the muzzle, having
a slit above, in the form of a cross, to aim by. There
is also outside the walls, and all round, as at Gibraltar
and Malaga, an advanced work, on which guns were
mounted, at once multiplying the means of annoyance
and protecting the base of the walls from the enemy’s
shot. This place has three distinct internal defences,
with deep ditches traversing them. It seemed all
hollowed out; cisterns or mattamores for corn occupy
the centre. Close to one of the walls, and at a part
where the ground is low, there is a large square
opening, which must even now be fifty feet deep,
though a great quantity of rubbish has fallen in. A
solitary tower at the opposite point from the village
projects beyond the circuit of walls: the stories of
halls or vaults, with large embrasures or windows in
the three sides, combine the light and airy prospect
of a kiosk, with the gloomy grandeur of a fortress.
There the traveller that would muse should go, and
go alone, and ponder long.</p>

<p>The first object that meets the eye in approaching
Seville, is the Giralda, and it stands first in the estimation
of the inhabitants. Notwithstanding—or because
of—an incongruous Spanish
superstructure,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_321"></a><a href="#footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a></span> an
enormous bronze figure, fourteen feet high, with a
shield on the extended left arm, and a lance in the
right hand, is placed on the top—at once a statue
and a weathercock—its apparent inclination, as it
revolves, gives to the tower a certain manner, a gait
and gesture, as it were, unlike any other, and makes
it look like a great cypress bending to the breeze.</p>

<p>During the siege, the Moors proposed to pull it
down, as too sacred to be left; but were prevented
by the threat of St. Ferdinand, that if they touched
one stone, or rather brick, of it, he would not leave
one man alive. The singular name that belongs to
it, is brought forth deep from the Sevillian’s breast,
and its tones linger on his lips. It rivals the Immaculate
Conception as an emblem and an ornament; it
is seen in the painted windows of the churches and
cathedrals; it is embossed on the chairs, embroidered
on the dresses; prints of it are suspended on the
walls; it is to be found in the pictures of the altar-pieces
and the slabs of the pavement; it is copied in
the steeples of the surrounding towns; and, finally, it
has given to Seville her two patron saints. Two
potter girls of Triana, martyrs in Roman times—Santa
Justa and Santa Rufina—were seen in a vision
only three centuries and a half ago, supporting the
Giralda during a storm and earthquake, and were
enshrined as the tutelary saints. This event is the
subject of one of the most incongruous, though not
the least beautiful, of the pictures of Murillo.</p>

<p>This tower claims for its architect the supposed inventor
of Algebra, and it was raised by one of the
most powerful of monarchs, Jacob the Second, of the
Almohades. It has been spared alike by the Vandalism
and fanaticism of conquest, the ravages of war,
the lightning that hath struck, and the earthquakes
that have shattered the humbler edifices around. It
is the embellishment of Seville; her pride, her
standard-bearer, her nightly watch-tower, the plume
of her mural coronet, first caught by the eye of the
stranger, and last seen. The Giralda is said to be
superior to the towers of Rabat and Morocco; but
there is no comparison either in the materials, the
ornaments, or dimensions.</p>

<p>On reaching the gallery, the clangour of bells strikes
one, as replacing the Muezzin call, “God is great.
To prayers.” “Prayer is better than sleep.” There
are a dozen great bells, which send forth the most
discordant and unceasing peals, and the ringing of
them is a strange exhibition. They are swung round
and round; the rope is allowed to coil itself round
the stock, or is jerked on the lip of the bell, and the
ringer springs up by stanchions in the wall to get a
purchase, and then throws himself down; or he allows
himself to be carried by the rope as it swings round
outside. As I entered the gallery, I saw one of the
ringers thrown out, as I imagined, and expected, of
course, that he was dashed on the pavement below; I
saw him the next moment perched on the bell, smiling
at my terror.</p>

<p>The belfry does, however, discharge as a steeple,
several of the functions to which it was appropriated
as a minaret: the day, as in Mussulman countries, is
divided by prayer. When you ask in Morocco, at
what hour you are to arrive at such a place;—if they
mean at sunset, they will answer, “at Assar.” So other
hours are marked by the first prayer, or the mid-day
prayer, and this is made known to all, not only by
the muezzin’s call, but also by a flag hoisted on the
minaret,—called <dfn>alem</dfn>. The Spaniards, in like manner,
divide the time by the prayers, the oracion, the
animas, &amp;c., the period of which is announced generally,
in the south of Spain, from the towers that the
Musselmans built for the same purpose.</p>

<p>The view from the Giralda invited me to ascend
it daily during my stay. Whether it was calm or
windy, whether in sunshine or shade, the charm was
the same in its diversities: the lightness of the atmosphere
in every change, justified the saying of the
Sevillians, “Our climate is fit to raise the dead.”</p>

<p>From this height it requires no great effort to replace,
in imagination, the dead level by an arm of
the sea; the tide still rises four feet in the river,
though fifty miles from the
sea.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_322"></a><a href="#footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a></span>
It is only thirty
years since it has been deprived of the monopoly of the
commerce of the New World; the caravels and argosies
of Santa Fé deposited upon that bank their precious
freights, as is still recorded in the name of the round
tower by the water,—<dfn>sorride oro</dfn>.</p>

<p class="p2 center allsmcap">HOSPITAL DE LA SANGRE.</p>

<p>This is a noble edifice, composed of several grand
courts and of two stories, the lower one for summer,
and the upper one for winter. I think I may say that
to each patient is allotted at least four times as much
space as in any similar European establishment, and
the very troughs in which the dirty linen is washed are
marble: the patients have two changes of clean linen
in the week. The kitchens are all resplendent with
painted tiles and cleanliness, and there seemed abundance
of excellent food. In these institutions, in Spain,
the inmates are completely at home. Soft and blooming
girls, with downcast look and hurried step, were
attending upon the poor, the maimed, and the suffering.
The Lady-Directress had told the servant who
accompanied me, to bring me, after my visit, to her
apartment, which was a hall in one of the corners of
the building: she said she had heard that England
was celebrated for its charity, and asked if our poor
and sick were better off than in Spain. I was obliged
to confess that the reverse was the case. She was,
however, better informed than I at first suspected.
She asked me if it was not true that we hired mercenaries
to attend on the sick and abstained from performing
that duty ourselves; and if our charity was
not imposed as a tax? She told me that there were
eight hundred of her order in Spain; that it was the
only one that had not been destroyed; that none
were admitted but those of noble birth or of gentle
blood; and that they took all the vows except that
of seclusion, and in lieu of it took that of service to
the poor and sick. The St. Isabelle, of Murillo,
painted for them, was the model of their order.
The Hospital de la Sangre was founded by a woman.</p>

<p class="p2 center allsmcap">THE CARTUJA.</p>

<p>This interesting convent is across the water. It is
now a pottery, and the property of an Englishman,
who very obligingly accompanied me over the works.
I never saw the Spanish people to more advantage:
they were models, in both sexes, of classic and Andalusian
beauty. Their costume was peculiarly well-preserved;
and the work—itself cleanly—was carried
on in the midst of noble structures, surrounded with
the finest chiseling, the grandeur of vaults and the
gorgeousness of azuleos. I inquired for the sepulchral
stone of St. Hermangildo, and after some search, and
the removal of a heap of stones, we found it let into
the wall at the east end of the church. The proprietor,
on my urgent entreaty, promised he would
have it conveyed to some place of safety.</p>

<p>I was anxious to get at the feelings of the people
working in this sacred edifice. Although familiarity
had destroyed any strong impressions, they all seemed
to regret the splendour of their domicile, and expressed
gratitude to their master for fitting up one of
the chapels for public service. He himself told me
that he had at first preserved the church of worship,
but finding that it excited the congregation that the
monastery should have been so disposed of, and have
become the property of a heretic, he deemed it prudent
to exert his rights and convert the church to
the uses of the manufactory. As they were drawing
a distinction between the church and the monastery,
he thought the time might come when they would
reassert their claim to the possession of the monastery
as well as to the church. If I had had no other occasion
to judge of the prospect of future tranquillity for
Spain, this would have sufficed to assure me that,
while this intrusion upon the monastic property endures,
no settlement will be made. In England and in
France, church confiscation was accompanied with a
change of belief, and those possessed either of hereditary
influence or of political power were the
acquirers.</p>

<p>No influential body has profited by the confiscation,
or risen to power by the possession, of this wealth.
The wealth itself has disappeared—it was the reaction
from the sale of church property that restored
France to the community of Rome. The sale of the
property of a church not upset; the penury and suffering
of its clergy (a clergy which sits in the confessional
and administers the viaticum, doubtless exercises its
power of quickening the religious sense of Spain, especially
as the manifestations of it are suppressed)—may
in like manner produce a reaction.</p>

<p>The Cortes receives no petition upon the subject of
church property, and the Crown listens to no prayers
against the Cortes.</p>

<p>The tithes never were supposed to be appropriated
to the church by the State. The tithes in each spot
had a special and chartered
origin.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_323"></a><a href="#footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a></span>
The church was
the continuation of the Mozarabic worship, and was
supported by obtubia and not by tithes. It was not
the tenth but the twentieth part. The tithe was in
fact legally fixed at five per cent. of the gross
produce.</p>

<p>From this tithe the clergy paid a revenue to the
State of their annual cures and professions; it
amounted some years ago to 180,000,000 reals.
The church now figures in the budget as a charge
of 140,000,000; the difference amounts to one half
the entire revenue of Spain, and the property itself
has been wholly swallowed up. This country suffers
at present only from the central government. The
clergy, as a corporation, presents a check: the dues
paid by the church would have been sufficient for all
the purposes of government.</p>

<p>These unfortunate proceedings are laid at England’s
door, as being the patron of the minister who introduced
the change; she is also charged with supporting
antinational governments with loans; which, while
giving a temporary triumph to a hollow faction, impose
permanent obligations and disgrace. Nor is it one of
the least evil consequences that Spain, like other countries
similarly situated, is considered in England as
under an obligation to her.</p>

<h4 class="h4head"><span class="allsmcap">THE CATHEDRAL.</span></h4>

<p class="p2">This building has neither façade, spire, nor dome; it
gives no external signs of grandeur, is surrounded by no
open space to exhibit its dimensions; there is nothing
to raise or satisfy expectation,—following the plan of
the Mosque, which it has replaced, and which rose on
the ruins of the Roman temple, its predecessor. The
cathedral externally is lost in the mass of buildings
which forms a parallelogram of 600 by 500 feet, across
which it runs; the remainder being made up of a
parish church, a parterre of orange trees, the Giralda
tower, the sacristy, and offices. As seen from a distance
with its flat roof, it appears like a large
house in a village; for in the clearness of that sky
distances are lost. When it is pointed out as the
cathedral, any anticipations you may have indulged in
are sobered down. The mind of the spectator is thus
artfully managed, and the majesty of the building is
veiled.</p>

<p>Till you stand within its vaults—I entered not by
its own portal, but by the parish church which opens
into it—I thought I was in the cathedral, and looked
around in surprise and disappointment. I presently
perceived an opening, and wandering in the direction,
I thought I was advancing up the nave—it was the
width that was before me! Now the tower-like pilasters
opened all around; but the limit I could not see,
for the view is intercepted by the built-up choir. There
is no one point from which all is to be seen—you have
the sense of the vastness of the whole wherever you
look, but which is nowhere paraded for you to admire.
You wander around to look for what is to be seen,—to
find what is to be admired—as you would through
a forest of trees.</p>

<p>Raised upon the lines of a mosque and a temple,
this building differs wholly from Gothic churches;—there
is no lengthened nave—no cross;—it is a
parallelogram supported by rows of pilasters, like the
Temple of Phyle. The scantling of a church is only to
be found in the distribution of the roof, ascending
higher in the nave and transept, so as to make the cross.
Six rows of pilasters traverse it in length, which support
seven rows of roofs or vaults. The nave and transept
are 120 feet in height; the two aisles adjoining
it on each side are 100; and the two outer aisles are
lower, and divided into chapels. The centre vault above
the high altar is 142 feet. At the eastern extremity it
opens into the Lady Chapel, itself a spacious church;
while another, the sacristy, adjoining it to the south, is
reached by a passage. The chapels conceal the altar
and shroud the paintings, and their gratings seem to
close in dens; so that the edifice, excepting the choir,
is as a cavern. The stone is without carving or monument;
there is no line save what belongs to the
construction:—the pillars ascend, the arches join as if
the rock had thus fashioned itself; the only exception
is the slight tracery of the balustrade of the triforium,
and the fret-work of the graining of the central and
adjoining vaults. But, contrasting with their grey
dulness, the floor is in slabs of marble, alternately
black and white in squares and lozenges.</p>

<p>The chapels have their own windows. The body of
the church has two clerestory rows, one in the nave,
one in the second side-aisle above the chapels, besides
a Catherine wheel in each corresponding gable.
They correspond: there is one to each vault—their
lines are in perfect symmetry with the vaults and
columns; they are deeply coloured and furnished with
curtains, by which the light is regulated, and, when
requisite, the sun on the eastern and southern sides
excluded. What we all feel regarding the “management”
of the light of a painting I now saw in an
edifice. How improved its merits—how magnified its
vastness—the effects of colossal magic lanterns played
around!</p>

<p>Here presided the spirit of the Moors; the gloom in
which they delight; the deep colour of the admitted
rays, repeating the figures and tints of their gorgeous
walls, and streaming with a sweet yet solemn beauty
on their graceful ornaments. These last, indeed, were
wanting, and their Sevillian pupils were determined
to show what colour and the sun alone could do. As
he travels round, looking in from the different sides
and windows, a thousand beauties reveal themselves
with all the changes of breaking or departing day.</p>

<p>Within this living rock of Gothic grandeur, one feels
the nearest approach to the sublimity of the conception
of the mosque, imitated by the Arab from the Desert,
and the heavens between which his lot has been cast.
The high altar has no gorgeous canopy, as in St. Peter’s;
there are no gems, as in the chapel of the Medici;
neither mosaic nor painting nor gilding meet the
eye;—it is surrounded on the sides and in front by a
lofty iron gilded grating, through which you can distinguish
a screen filling up the width of the chancel, and
rising seventy or eighty feet above the altar. This
space is divided into compartments by four horizontal
and five perpendicular lines, each of which contains a
group of figures, in alto and basso relievo, diminishing
as they ascend, the four figures coming fully out, and
the accessories being traced in slight relief behind. Of
these groups there are thirty-six, the principal figures
two-thirds the size of life, and over each a Gothic
canopy: they are separated by Gothic spaces, with
niches and statues of various sizes. The cusps are
enriched and enlivened with fine branches and foliage.
Over the whole projects a cornice composed of the
Twelve Apostles in niches, and the descent from the
cross in the centre. These figures are the size of life.
This cornice is a frame-work of Gothic niches for holding
the statues, while branches are interlaced through
its dentated spires and cusps. It fails only in the
curve beneath the projection to a corridor which sustains
the Twelve Apostles, and which correspond with
hexagons. Here would have been peculiar scope for
the adaptation either of the Gothic pendants, or the
Moorish stalactite.</p>

<p>On the top, in the centre, is Christ on the cross, and
the two Marys kneeling. These are a little larger
than life. The groups contain between 300 and 400
figures. There are 200 small statues on the Gothic
pinnacles dividing them: seventeen statues the size of
life are on the cornice and in the group above. The
whole space, which is above 4000 square feet, is about
equally divided between groups and statues, and
tracery and foliation. The ornaments display the beauties
of the pointed Gothic style, with the richness of
the Moresque white, serving as the frame-work to the
exquisite Italian groupings. During three generations
it passed from master to pupil, and from father to son,
and the design was unbroken; and, with the one
exception I have mentioned, the whole is perfect as if
it had been dreamt by a Cellini at night and executed
in the morning. When you look upon it, you forget
even the cathedral.</p>

<p>I was able to get the great doors opened at the
period when the cathedral is closed, and thus see the
whole mass at once, and unimpeded. The most distinct
sight is from the organ-loft, between twelve and
one o’clock, when the side-light falls on the left wing,
and slightly illumines the heads over the screen, and
you may trace the wonderful minuteness of the ornaments.
But all these glimpses are nothing to be compared
to the unearthly effect of the setting-sun, when
the light through the St. Catherine Wheel over the
great door streams full upon its different shades.</p>

<p>I was about to say that ten minutes on this spot, at
this hour, is worth a journey to Seville; but it is vain
to rate the worth of what stands alone, and which furnishes
a new standard to rate the resources of art, the
genius of man, and the beauty of nature. All are here
combined within the majesty of a temple consecrated to
the highest aims of life, and the hopes of eternity. This
effect of the evening sun I thus described in a letter, at
the moment of witnessing it:—</p>

<p>“I was passing the cathedral nearly at sunset. I went
in intending merely to pass through: it was very dark—the
light from the western windows streamed like a
phantasmagoria. I got the sacristan to let me into
the choir, and I sat down on the archbishop’s throne
at the bottom of the chancel, opposite the high altar,
with my back to the light, which, passing over the
choir, fell full on the upper part of the screen. It
was not white light, but deeply-coloured, and the
distance from the window blended the tints, so that
it came like a rainbow-cloud, and the groups passed
through every variety of hue. The light shifted as it
changed; it moved, ascending always to other groups,
and in the gloom they shone like visions in the sky.
The birth, fall, and redemption of the human race, was
the story of that wall. The rays then ascended, and
caused to shine forth the Apostles, and finally the
Calvary was brought to light. The kneeling Marys
appeared, not cased in tracery or canopied in Gothic
fret-work,—the depths of the temple were beyond
them;—then the sacrifice of the cross, limb by limb;
came forth, and just as the light reached and showed
the outlines of the Saviour’s head and face, averted
from its glow, a peal of a distant organ echoed through
the roofs, and a moment after voices, as of angels in the
clouds, supplied the tones of praises which the overpowered
lips of the beholder refused to utter. The
light was for a moment lost in the intervening
space, and then struck on the groined ribs of
the arches above, changing them to rainbows. The
orb of the sun touched the horizon; the rays glowed
fiery red and remotely yellow, and then all was grey—the
vision was gone—the natural light brought back
the earth. But I am not recovered, and write now,
still tremulous under the unearthly glow of that departing
sun—the sudden burst of that choral peal.”</p>

<p>It was days before I could deliberate. I was distracted
between the effects it presented and the
thoughts it inspired. The vistas of aisles upon aisles;
the beauteous curves; the tall aspiring lines; the dark
embrowning shades! There was light, but it was enshrined
in gloom, and was ever undergoing change as
the sun went round, or the clouds flitted across,—I
went there to expose my mind to its influence, as we
set plants in the sun that they may grow. It is sublime—there
is nothing for display; it is simple—there
is nothing for effect; it is harmonious, for it is all alike
and true to itself. Its vastness would not be grand
without its symmetry, nor its beauty harmonious without
its size;—magnificent in its simplicity, manifold in
its unity, it is but man’s performance, yet it elevates
our conception of God’s chief work. Yet our “advanced
age” can only gaze with stupid
bewilderment<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_324"></a><a href="#footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a></span> on
achievements such as these, whether of art or polity.</p>

<p>This glorious cavern, during the Holy Week, is
decked out in crimson brocade. In the centre of the
nave the monument itself, an imposing structure, is
reared; and the high altar, dark and solemn throughout
the remainder of the year, presents a blaze of light
before a shrine of silver: and then within these walls
and from that temple, the bell tolls and the horn
echoes, and before the altar is heard the click of the
castanet, and seen the solemn dance of Jewish and classical
antiquity.</p>

<p>This cathedral is unrivalled in several other respects.
It possesses the finest organ, vestry, and sacristy in the
world; the largest amount of silver plate and jewels:
the paintings are of greater value and number than
in any other church; the largest work, or rather monument,
in silver, in the world, is the <i>Gloria</i>, placed
behind the high altar in the Holy Week: it is twenty-five
feet in height; it was made from the first-fruits of
the mines of America, and saved during the war from
French sacrilege.</p>

<p>I did not fully estimate this cathedral till I entered
that of York. The nave of the one is not equal to the
aisles of the other. At York there is but one aisle, and
the flat wall stops the sight immediately beyond it.
The double side-aisles at Seville are equal in height to
the nave and transept at York. Three cathedrals of
York might stand, as to width, in that of Seville. In
York there is more glass than wall, and these are whitewashed:
its windows are its glory—their absence is the
splendour of Seville. The vastness of the one is increased
by its gloom, the size of the other diminished
by its glare: the one may excite admiration, curiosity—the
other inspires awe. The want of uniformity in the
building and arches at York, brings into evidence the
harmony of the Seville church; for the perfect
Gothic<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_325"></a><a href="#footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a></span>
reigns throughout, although four centuries elapsed
between its foundation and completion. In York, the
windows and the arches are more acute, the vault more
obtuse. The difference indeed is slight, but is quite
enough to shock the eye when fresh from the unblemished
symmetry of the other.</p>

<p>In the lower part of the screen separating the chancel
of York from the nave, the fifteen British kings,
from William I. to Henry <abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr>, are placed in niches
under Gothic canopies. Suppose this row of figures
with infinitely more luxurious embellishments, extended
a third in length, and expanded upwards by four or
five additional stories, and you would then have an idea
of the <i lang="es">retablo</i> high altar of Seville.</p>

<p>When we look on the tombs, the Nile, the heaps
of Babylon, the symmetry of the Erectheum, or the
pillared precipices of Syracuse, we are lifted into the
times of those who have left these traces of skill and
greatness. Had the Sevillians disappeared from the
earth, in what rank should we have placed them?
The ancient claims of Britain rest on Westminster
Hall; the revived aspirations of the fatherland of
Germany clusters around Cologne; the glory of the
Church of the West is St. Peter’s, as St. Sophia was
of that of the East; yet are each outdone and all surpassed
by the work of a provincial corporation, who
chanced one day to resolve they should “build such a
cathedral that future ages would call them mad.” No
monarch ordered the plan, no empire furnished the
means. This masterpiece was planned and reared by
hands unknown; the wealth was furnished by hard-earned
gains and persevering parsimony. Well may
the Andalusian speak of his “kingdom,” not his province.
What means “<em>great nations</em>” when a province
can accomplish such works?<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_326"></a><a href="#footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a></span>
When the arts flourished
in Italy, there were great men and small states; so in
Spain, the age of art reveals the independence which
belonged to her provinces. What was the universal
monarchy of Philip <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>, when the Cabildo (the Arab
tribe) which raised the cathedral without his aid,
existed despite his power?</p>

<p>A modern English
traveller<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_327"></a><a href="#footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a></span>
regrets that so much
wealth should thus lie unproductive, and suggests its
employment <em>to put an end</em> (he wrote at the time) to
the civil war—that is, to extinguish the liberty of the
Basques! Was an Englishman alone to be found to
propose the robbery of one of these provinces to aid
in <em>the treacherous design against another</em>?</p>

<h4 class="h4head"><span class="allsmcap">SPANISH PAINTING.</span></h4>

<p class="p2">One is accustomed to think of Spanish artists as
pupils only, even when rivals of the great masters with
whom we are familiar. Such, at least, was my impression,
and accordingly, no less was my surprise and
suspense than delight, at the first glance at the “Murillo
Chamber,” at Seville. The picture which faced
me, as I entered, was Christ bending from the cross to
embrace St. Felix, of Cantalicio—I might have taken it
for Vandyke: next came a St. Joseph, equally admirable,
yet different; then a San Leandro—the one
might have been from the pencil of Dominichino, the
other of Titian; and so I turned, from picture to
picture, finding new rivals to every standard and
style of excellence. The question then arose of comparison
between the Spanish, the Italian, and Flemish
schools. Afterwards, at Madrid, I visited repeatedly
the Spanish collections, to possess myself thoroughly
with them before visiting the Italian and Flemish
galleries. A severer test I could not apply, for the
gallery of the foreign schools, at Madrid, is the richest
in the world. Here are the grander compositions of
Vandyke. One of Raphael, the <i>Spasimo</i>, might, if in
the Vatican, displace from its throne the Transfiguration.
Three or four masterpieces, besides ten others,
are from Raphael’s pencil, and form a collection of
his works equal to that of the Vatican. Of Titian,
there is a gallery in itself—no less than forty paintings
all on a large scale. Amongst these is the celebrated
one of “Fruitfulness;” a flock of cherubs, just
as you may see chickens collected under an inverted
basket in the streets of any Spanish town, and which,
if anything, would eclipse or rival Murillo in the
gracefulness and variety of his infantine conceptions.
The result of the comparison was to relieve me from
the restraint of habit, and I could, with conviction
and boldness now assert, that in painting, Spain has
no rival.</p>

<p>The Spanish school is most various; but in all its
varieties it is natural. It has no particular manner:—manner
is no more than systematic or constitutional
failing.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_328"></a><a href="#footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a></span>
It is the error to which a man is liable, and
which, when he founds a system and instructs others,
is more readily caught by his pupils than his merits,—a
colourless and unblemished glass is invisible. We
become sensible of its presence by its changing the
hue or distorting the ray. And so manner in painting
either perverts or obscures nature.</p>

<p>Nature, in her varieties, has a counterpart in the
Spanish school. She is represented darkly in Ribera
and Roelas, mildly in Cano, richly in Morales, boldly in
Zurbaran, brightly in Velasquez, divinely in Murillo.</p>

<p>The school of Spain is solemn. The subjects which
were alone worthy to be immortalized, were those
which pertained to immortality, and art was dignified
no less in its application than its powers. Painting
was a religious exercise. The enthusiasm of art was
linked to fervour of faith. The studio was an oratory,
and “each work was commenced and prosecuted with
fasting and
prayer.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_329"></a><a href="#footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a></span>
The lords were the convents;
the inmates were sons at once of the founder and of the
peasant. For these Spanish art exercised her calling,
not to please the caprice of a virtuoso, or to tapestry
the walls of a Sybarite. Seville or Cordova presented
no Flemish pot-houses. In the productions of their
masters, there was none of the extravagant mythology
of a Rubens, or the more finished lasciviousness of a
Titian; no dissecting-room of a Michael Angelo; none
of the finery of a Paolo Veronese. There were neither
allegories, portraits, nor giants wrestling with the rocks.</p>

<p>The stranger who visits only Madrid will be surprised
at such a description, for he has there seen
what is called the “Spanish Rooms,” filled with portraits,
allegories, extravagances, dwarfs, heathen gods,
and historical compositions, and these constitute in
his eyes the masterpieces of Spanish art. The reason
is this; that at Madrid are collected the paintings
of Velasquez, who is so far Spanish only as the want
of manner makes him so. Born in Seville, he became
a Madrileño, and a parasite. His pictures are all at
the capital, and in the style suited to the taste of
foreigners. The Spaniards of the capital esteem their
painter, and are reacted upon by the estimation in
which he is held by foreigners.</p>

<p>The thought in all things comes before the execution.
What would the work of him who chiselled
the Apollo Belvidere have been, if applied to the
person of a Souter Johnny? So the art of Velasquez
was expended on Philips and abortions. His paintings
are common-place domestic scenes, or they are
classical, and there he parodies the poets of Greece
and travesties their gods. His chief works are beautiful
caricatures in oil, without satire and without
fun. Before returning to Murillo and Seville, I must
say a few words of his chief works.</p>

<p><span class="title">Vulcan’s Forge</span> is an exquisitely finished group
of naked Spaniards, with arms, breasts, shoulders,
and loins developed. They are heavy below, as if
trampers, not blacksmiths; nor have they been hardened
and bronzed by exposure to the air, the furnace,
or the sun: they have had their clothes taken off
within the hour: the shirts must have been filthy;
the bodies are unwashed. The picture is an exposure
of nakedness. The walls of the place, and the manners,
and the countenances, would appear rather an
effort to unidealize the Greek, than to raise the modern
to a conception of ancient poetry. In it there is the
genius of painting, not the painting of a man of
genius.</p>

<p><span class="title">The Belidores.</span> Drunkards; or, Bacchus among his
Companions.—These are Castilian peasants engaged
in a most un-Spanish debauch. One naked, and bearing
a classic wreath, personates Bacchus, with a
maudlin solemnity on a sensual countenance. Another
presents a full face of coarse and stupid laughter,
and wears on his head something between a
Spaniard’s sombrero and an Irish hat. This is the
picture Wilkie selected from out the treasures of
Madrid, to admire, to study, to imitate; copying and
recopying it, and so fixing in his own mind the physiognomy
of the laughing drunkard with the Irish hat,
as thence to bring forth a numerous progeny, sometimes
with a hat more, sometimes less, the worse for
wear.</p>

<p><span class="title">The Spinners.</span> A Flemish picture, as seen through
a magnifying glass: the scene such as Teniers or
Ostade might have selected. Two women, a young and
an old one, are sitting spinning at the wheel. Between
them the back shop is seen with customers and
tapestry exposed for sale—and, therefore, this is a painting
highly admired by the English. The back-ground
is remarkable for its light, or rather for the shades;
for painting, like the magic lantern, produces brightness
by shutting out the light. Wilkie said of Velasquez,
“he paints the very air we breathe;” just so a
clear and perfect mirror might be described as glass.
One of the pictures of the same master has been
called “The Theology of Painting,” and another, “The
Philosophy of Light.” His perspectives and distances
are not rendered by lines, or by any peculiarity of
construction or drawing. He put on the canvas
what he saw.</p>

<p>If it is wonderful to see a limb or a figure, even
when all the picture is consecrated to that effort,
break forth, as it were, from the dead surface and
rise towards you, how much more to behold that
canvas fly open and spread back, so that by the aid
of a tremulous ray, breaking across it here and there,
you may see around and distinguish things, places,
and persons! This is the triumph of the art of
painting, and here Velasquez stands alone.</p>

<p><span class="title">The Studio.</span>—Here, like one of those vaudevilles,
in which the wings of a stage are represented, and
you hear the plaudits of another audience “within”—the
artist is seen at the corner of his picture, the
back of it being towards you. There are a dog, dwarfs,
and a lady-in-waiting in attendance on an infantine
Infanta, who is standing for her portrait. The presence
of the royal parents is signified by another stage-claptrap—their
reflection in a mirror. All the figures
are splendid as separate parts, but there is no dignity
in any expression, or any purpose in the whole.
When Philip saw this picture, he said, “One thing
is wanting,” and taking the palette and the brush, he
traced the cross of St. Jago on the artist’s breast.</p>

<p><span class="title">The Surrender of Breda</span>—or the Picture, as it, is
called, of the Lances,—from the number and the
thickness of the forest of these that appear to the
right. This is indeed a grand composition. It owes
its power to its being a portrait and a history of the
chief figure. The noble and chivalrous Spinola, with
an expression of courteous grief, is bending down, and
laying his hand upon the shoulder of his commonplace
and stern, though vanquished, opponent. The
exaltation of triumph is subdued. The victor’s
thoughts are with the unfortunate. What a representation
of victory! Here, for once, the correctness
of the eye has supplied the place of the sight of the
mind, and his pencil, like Allan’s in the Polish Exiles,
was above himself.</p>

<p>The last I shall notice is his Christ upon the Cross,—the
only picture of this description, with one exception,
which I have found among seventy. It is
an immortal work.</p>

<p>I cannot quit the Gallery of Madrid without some
notice of an incident which fixed two pictures especially
on my memory in the description of the Gallery.
The two subjoined pictures will be found in Murray’s
Hand-book, “No. 121,—<i>Prometheus</i>, a finely painted
picture of <span class="allsmcap">GORE</span> and <span class="allsmcap">BOWELS</span>;
<em>such alone as could be
conceived by a bull-fighter</em>, and <em>please a people whose
sports are blood and torture</em>. How different from the
same subject by the poetical Titian, See No. 787.”
“No. 787, <i>Prometheus</i>,”—compare the <em>poetical treatment
by our Italian</em>, with 121, the <span class="allsmcap">BUTCHER PRODUCTION</span>
of the practical Spaniard, Ribera: it is “Æschylus to
Torquemada.” I fancied, having examined the two
pictures, that the writer had mistaken the one for the
other; I therefore returned to the Museum, Guidebook
in hand, and remained satisfied that it was the
deliberate purpose of the writer to represent the
pictures as he has done.</p>

<p>The <span class="title">Prometheus</span> of Titian (121), lies on his back on
the earth, with the heels in the air: the top of the<em>the
spectator</em>;—<em>the face is consequently not seen</em>. The
hero of Æschylus first endures reproach in silent scorn,
and then bursts forth in indignation, claiming unbounded
merit for his works.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_330"></a><a href="#footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a></span>
He stands, his face
to his accusers and to heaven. Here is a man lying on
his back! was thought or suffering to be expressed in
a head of shaggy hair? How treat with paint a subject
poetically without action and without feature? This,
Prometheus! the <em>fore-thinker</em>—this, the stealer of fire
from heaven! It is a corpse revived and cast upon
the rocks; and the picture, if that of a poet, must have
been designed to represent the deluge. The only animated
portion of the composition is the eagle—he is]
the predominating figure perched upon the body; for
by the manner of the fastenings, the man, if not quite
dead, could easily have driven him away. The Prometheus
of Æschylus is bound so that the winged dog
of Jupiter may come undisturbed to his uninvited
daily feast. This is no eagle; it is a vulture feeding
on carrion: the colouring is from the dissecting-room—but
not the anatomy. The bird has laid bare an
enormous surface of the putrid flesh, somewhere about
the breast, where there could be no such exposure of
muscle, and to which, moreover, the eagle’s commission
did not extend. Such is “the poetical treatment by
our Italian.”</p>

<p>In No. 787, the Spanish master has painted a man
full of life, not lying where he has been tossed, but
held where he is bound. His body writhes; one hand
supports him off the ground, the other is raised either
in agony or supplication. The drawn lineaments of
the face and the expanded mouth, make you listen
for the cry it is about to utter, or which has died
away. The tormentor is without his reach, and is <em>unseen</em>—you
may distinguish where he is, but you have
to strain the sight to penetrate the gloom in which
he broods;—there is no doubt of the presence of the
one, or of the cause of the agony of the other; for
from the slightly gashed <em>side</em>,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_331"></a><a href="#footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a></span>
a filament is being
drawn away. This is the “blood-battered subject,”
the “butcher production of gore and bowels” of our
Spaniard.</p>

<p>Ribera’s Prometheus would not stand were a Daniel
brought to judgment, for the eagle takes a Shylock’s
share, having no more right to the entrail, which he is
suffered to pilfer by the Spaniard, than to the carrion
on which he is gorged by the Italian.</p>

<p>Who ever painted such children as Murillo?—the
cherubs of Raphael are statuettes; those of Rubens,
fœtuses; Murillo’s are children and cherubs. The
brood is as prolific as the type is beautiful—golden,
rosy, dimpled, sporting in troops, or flying in flocks,
and then gathered into his canvas—light as the
air; bright as the rainbow, yet of flesh and blood;
full of life and grace, of vigour and ease, of health
and gladness.</p>

<p>Who ever painted such virgins? The Madonnas of
Italy are matrons and mothers. Mary holds her Child,
or she gazes on Him as she shows Him,—it is maternal
love. The Marys of Murillo are scarcely past the
verge of childhood; the cheeks are full and ruddy;
the form is plump. There is the ethereal, but it is in
the expression: the face is upturned, the large eye
raised, and the mouth half open, the hands pressed
across the breast. The figure is erect—the size natural.
They are never the same to look upon, and yet
each can only be described in the same words as the
rest. These bright Virgins in the sky, these laughing
cherubs in the clouds, fill the canvas of Murillo
with joy and innocence.</p>

<p>The gallery of Seville consists of a convent and
its church. The rooms, cloisters, and corridors are
all lined with paintings; the church is, in like manner,
filled with them, high and low and all around.
One chamber is set apart for Murillo: in it eighteen
or nineteen of his chief works, nearly all the size of
life, are collected. In reviewing them at an interval
of nineteen months, it is impossible for me to say
to which I would give the preference. One he used
to call “<em>my</em> picture.” It is the St. Thomas of Villanueva,
Archbishop of Valencia, distributing alms. It
draws neither on the tender nor the ideal, and the
selection indicates not the judgment of the artist, but
the disposition of the man. “The Adoration of the
Shepherds,” is, in colouring and conception, not unlike
the “Repose in Egypt” of Correggio, at Parma.</p>

<p>Santa Justa and Rufina sustaining the Giralda, is
beautifully executed, but incongruous and out of nature,
and has neither the pure tints nor the deep dyes of the
painter. The celebrated Señora de la Servilleta is a
gipsy woman of Triana. I have mentioned these two
as the pictures which pleased me the least; although
in the St. Felix receiving the Child from the Virgin,
how charmingly are infancy, young womanly beauty,
and ripe old age grouped and pourtrayed! It is three
pictures, not one. That of St. Antonio is fervour without
fanaticism. Leandro is majestic and triumphant
prelacy, in Venetian brocade, under an oriental sun.
Like to it are the two ideal portraits, or rather real
portraits, under the names of Leandro and Isidore
in the sacristy of the cathedral. There are three
Conceptions—<i lang="es">una de diversâ</i>—blooming maidens in
the same attitude, arrayed in white and blue, with
angels in the clouds; and yet there is no monotony.
They have the serenity of beauty of the Sevillian
maidens, by whom Murillo’s pencil was inspired; but
the fulness of the lower part of the face reminded
me of the women of modern Rome—the grave, dark-eyed,
thoughtful Romans. The Saint Joseph with the
Infant Jesus is a high-minded Jew, and the child, a
prodigy. This picture recalls one in the cathedral
which I may here notice, as in speaking of that building
I could think of nothing but itself. The picture
I mean is, the “Guardian Angel.” An angel leads
a child and points to heaven: the figures are less
than life. The picture is dark, the tints are not
clear, the outline not distinct: there is no grace in
the form of either, no beauty in the face; yet in
this consists the triumph of the master—the inward
mind shines through the veil, and you are sent at
once to the inspiration that has descended, and to
the innocence that looks up. This picture is an admirable
exponent of the imaginative temperament of
Murillo. He could revere, and hope, and wonder,
to bring forth by pencil-strokes, the compassionate
calm, with the benevolent anxiety of the angel’s face
and the trustingness of that of the child—mingled
with the searching expression that follows the angel’s
finger, as to find the heavenly realms which those
alone like it, can seek or see!</p>

<p>The church at the Museum contains the St. Thomas
of Zurbaran—held by some to be the finest picture
in the world; the St. Dominic, a remarkable carving
in wood, by Montañes; and masterpieces by
almost all the Sevillian school. I had visited it several
times, scarcely noticing two or three pictures
by Murillo, placed there as not worthy of admission
to the “Murillo Chamber.” One of these, however,
haunted me after leaving the Museum. Next morning,
and at the earliest hour admittance could be gained,
I went to examine it. It was a Virgin, but of a different
order from his other Virgins—colossal, looking,
not up to heaven, but down on earth; the hands
joined and raised, not crossed upon the bosom; the
eye cast down, the ball covered. It is not the full
front figure upstretched; the left knee rests upon a
cloud, yet the right foot is planted with the firmness
of a statue. The dishevelled hair flows not on the
shoulders, but streams wildly; and the dark blue
mantle is whirled about and carried away. The picture
is divided into two zones,—the upper one of gold—the
sun; the lower one frigid and pale. She floats
between heaven and earth. The picture is placed high
in the apse. As you approach and recede, she seems
now to ascend and now to descend. You cannot tell
whether it is an angel coming down to men, or a
saint rising to the sky.</p>

<p>His other Virgins are beautiful;—this one is heroic:
his other figures are flesh and blood, this one is of
marble. His other Marys are timid, hopeful, innocent;
this is one of consciousness. The others are
absorbed and ecstatic; this is a youthful Juno—the
Spanish form. The Andalusian features give way to
the ideal lines of the Greeks. His other Virgins wear
the outward expression of some mental character associating
the weakness of humanity with the beauty of
nature. Here there is no part you can singly grasp;
no feature you can separate, explain, or admire;—fleeting
like the cloud, it dazzles like the sun. The
vision enters as the tones of music, and returns on
the memory like a vessel’s track in the night.</p>

<p>Such was the vision which Petrarch beheld when
he exclaimed, “Beautiful Virgin! clothed with the
sun, crowned by the stars, and so pleasing to the
sun that his light he has hidden in thee!” No wonder
that the Andalusian peasants’ salutation should be,
“Santa Maria purissima,” or the reply, “Sin peccado
concebida.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_332"></a><a href="#footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a></span></p>

<p>The “Virgin of the Franciscans” is amongst pictures
what the Apollo Belvidere is among statues—a
constellation of heavenly graces. I felt that it must
have a history. I turned over such books as were
within reach, but found no mention of it, except in
one recent publication, where it is noticed as an extravagant
production that had corrupted the taste of
Seville; but, on inquiring among the Sevillians, I
found that my anticipations were not vain.</p>

<p>Imagine Murillo in the fulness of his years, and
still in the height of his power, called upon by the
corporation of the Cathedral to paint a Virgin for that
edifice, to crown at once that unrivalled work, and
his own unequalled fame. Imagine him pacing that
hall, raising his eyes to its vault, and his mind to the
effort. This was not to be a picture to be placed on
a wall, enclosed in a chapel, or screened on an altar-frame:
it was to be an emblem of descending charity
and ascending prayer, radiating through its vastness,
and filling its space. Go then to the Museum and
contemplate the “Virgin of the Franciscans,” and you
will understand why she looks down—why her joined
hands are raised—why she is colossal—how she is
sublime.</p>

<p>When the picture was finished, the Cabildo <em>proceeded</em>
to judge of it, and exclaimed: <cite>Ayach che
mamarachio</cite>, “Oh! what a daub.” Murillo made a
present of it to the Franciscans, the advocates of
the <em>essential</em> purity of the Virgin. It was suspended
under the dome of their church: all Seville poured
forth to behold it, the Cabildo among the rest.</p>

<p>The Cabildo was personified in a Sevillian connoisseur,
who was offended at my admiration. “If you
saw it close,” said he, “as I have, you would think
nothing of it.” It was useless to tell him that it was
designed for the other side of a gulf—that it was
painted to represent the heavens; to be seen from—not
to touch—the earth. The critic pointed to the
contradictions of the cloak flying on the right side,
and the hair on the left;—in vain I answered that it
was not a ship, and that in that distraction of the
elements, in which she stands motionless, consisted
the poetry of the work. Murillo has filled the Caridad;
and hence his pictures have been less scattered.
There are, however, five vacant spaces. Of two the
robber still retains possession; two he has sold to an
English duke, who has hitherto mistaken the pleasure
of possessing a good picture for that of performing
a good deed; the fifth, on its way back from Paris,
was detained at the Academy of Madrid. <em>Taste</em> being
as good a <em>plea for plunder</em> as philanthropy: sense or
anger suggested to the Sevillians to leave the place of
these pictures vacant—they have hung curtains on the
empty spaces: seven still remain. Two of these are
the largest he has painted, and represent multitudes—the
Distribution of loaves and fishes, and Moses striking
the rock;—two are Annunciations, in very different
styles, the one bright and beautiful, the other large,
dark, and solemn; in this one the Virgin is the
<i lang="fr">beau idéal</i> of a Sevillian in her mantilla;—two are
gems in size as well as worth,—a John the Baptist
and an infant Christ: the former is especially beautiful:—the
seventh is a St. Juan di Dios, the founder
of hospitals—a dark picture. The saint is carrying a
sick man to the hospital, and an angel, a tall youth
with outspread wings, is supporting him. Opposite to
it hangs a curtain—let me raise it.</p>

<p>In the vesture of a nun, with the halo of a saint and
the crown of a queen, Isabella stands over a boy whose
head she is laving. The boy bends over a large silver
vessel, from which the reflected light illumines his
flushed face and winking eye, leaning on the stool
which supports the basin: he is suffering, but patient,
under the hands that perform the office. How the soft
fingers hold—yet scarcely touch—the head!—how
gently they apply the napkin! Beside her stands a
maiden with a golden jewelled ewer; she watches till
the cloth is dry;—an elderly lady looks from behind
to counsel and aid her mistress. A second attendant
carries a tray with ointment, and over her shoulder,
in eastern fashion, hangs a lace embroidered napkin.
The service is regal, not dramatic. There are other
patients ready to be served. An old man in front is
unbinding his leg; another is limping in on crutches
from behind: there is no crowd, but there is work
prepared for these lovely hands. The queen’s eyes are
averted from the sores beneath her touch, and rest on
an old woman below, whose upturned face reveals
awe and gratitude. The sores on the boy’s head show
the blush of granulation; but the care of the queen is
still required. Who said the painting made him smell
the sore?<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_333"></a><a href="#footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a></span>—it
is clean and washed and healthy.</p>

<p>There are here no forms of unnatural beings—no
forced images—no angels’ wings: it is Isabella in her
palace, amidst her ladies, at her ordinary work—nothing
that is not simple; nothing that is not true;
nothing pictured except that which has been; and
pictured that it may prompt others to do the same—nothing
that is not common, save that such deeds are
as rare as the hands by which they are here performed.</p>

<p>Amongst living beings I have seen one whose life is
told in this picture—and it is her portrait. Murillo
must have known some such one; from her life derived
the thought, and from her face the model. She
bears no resemblance to his Virgins. There are here no
ideal lines—no blushing tints; no childlike innocence
is here—that face is mild and solemn, and full of care
and tenderness. He must have seen it in a
sister.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_334"></a><a href="#footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a></span></p>

<p>This picture is now in the Academy at Madrid, with
two of his masterpieces,—the Dream of the Roman
Patrician. The Virgin appeared to him, directing him
to build the Church of St. Maria Maggiore. The
second represents him narrating his dream to the
Pope. This head is the original, which Wilkie has
copied for his great picture of Columbus. He was
painting it when I first saw that artist, and I was
struck by it as singularly inappropriate. I now saw
how he had selected it—here it was masterly because
suited to the character represented. It is without
power, elevation, or resolution; but is noble, soft,
pious, and munificent. Wilkie admired it as the
founder of a Basilicon, and placed it on the shoulders
of the discoverer of America.</p>

<p>The Isabella pourtrays charity; the “sleeping Patrician”—rest.
The one abstracts the soul from surrounding
things; the other subjects you to them:—you
lighten your step and fear to tread. The Roman is seated
in a chair by the table, on which lies his closed book;
he has gently dropped asleep, his head resting on his
hand. Nothing is recumbent, but all is still: it is the
rest of the spirit rather than the slumber of the frame:
the spirit is elsewhere; the sleep so light, yet the
abstraction so deep, that you watch for a breathing.
The light falls on his reclining head from the vision
of Mary and her child above. On the floor near his
feet, seated by her work—the work laid down and her
head reclining on a cushion—his daughter lies in profound
slumber: her dog, curled at her feet, is asleep
too. The picture—no, the chamber—is otherwise in
darkness. By what door did he enter? Hush! lest
they awake!</p>

<p>To see this picture, close the windows.</p>

<p>I took leave of Murillo. This was the last of his
great works that I looked upon; its tone the last to
dwell on mine eyes, mingling with those of the St.
Isabella and the Mary of the Franciscans, which constitute
it in my mind the ideal of painting.</p>

<p>I cannot suppress my indignation at such masterpieces
being kept and shown in gilt gaudy frames,
and huddled together like the wares of an old curiosity
shop. The eye is tortured by the glare, and the mind
oppressed by the numbers. They were painted for
altar-pieces; they were designed to dwell in the glare
of the Temple; to be gazed upon by the kneeling
penitent on the floor. How is it that, with our virtuoso
faith, our religion of sentiment, no one dreams
of replacing them on their thrones or pedestals, where,
with nothing to distract the thought or oppress the
eye, they may, if no longer fitted to inspire devotion,
at least fill and raise the heart.</p>

<p>Our age has produced a descriptive epic, of which
Italy is the scene and heroine. Her fortune, ruins,
arts, monuments, are the incidents; the works of her
genius are transmuted into verse; and if the marble
perished, the Venus and the Gladiator in Childe
Harold, would live. But where are the St. John, the
Holy Family, the Transfiguration, the Last Supper, the
Flight into Egypt, the Descent from the Cross, the
Last Judgment? How is it that sculpture’s rainbow-sister
has claimed no tribute, and inspired no strain—that
all things in Italy are there but Raphael, Titian,
Guido, and the Caracci? After seeing Murillo I understood
this blank. Byron in his portraits of statues,
enters upon no artistic disquisitions—they were to
him the subject they represented, as if seen in life,
or conceived in fancy; and he brings back from the
marble to flesh and blood, and discovers as such the
struggle of the Trojan father and the disdainful majesty
of the archer-god. The failing head of the
Dacian awakens the scene and circumstances of his
end, and the great and beautiful grief of the Phrygian
mother recalls the desolation of the mother-mistress of
cities and of the world. Where was the painting in
Italy possessed of such a spell?</p>

<p>I may now confess that in Italy I never saw a picture
that satisfied my judgment, however much it may
have excited my admiration. In admiring one or more,
there was an internal struggle to impose upon myself a
standard of excellence, in what was the most excellent
of known works. The canvases of Murillo reconciled
me to myself, by presenting a higher level, or at least a
more perfect adaptation. Other masters may have
been in artistic powers superior to Murillo, but he
excels in a perfect knowledge and judgment of himself
in reference to the ends of art. What mortal
power or genius could present a Transfiguration so
that it should be natural? What truth could there be
in the struggle of the Giants and Jupiter? Could
you be transported in spirit to the foreground of
Purgatory, of the Last Judgment, of a beleaguered
Fortress, or a contested Field? What art could
render simple an assembly of the gods? The painting
might be exquisite, but the attempt would overpower
the master, or the subject would be beneath his
power.</p>

<p>It has been remarked, that when a person becomes
an admirer of Murillo, he is wholly fascinated and incapable
of all discrimination, admires his master’s
defects and despises all others’ merit. I feel that
fascination—if fascination it be—where you clearly
see the cause. No other painter ever awakened in me
curiosity. In him there is the metaphysician no less
than the artist. In other painters you may admire
the painting—in other pictures the painter. In Murillo
it is the poet. Colour is his verse, light and shadow his
metre; and his were dreams rather than poetry; or he
dreamed as a poet and painted when he awoke. There
is no drama in his scenes—it is ecstacy or thought.
From the metaphysics of the mind he passed to the
psychology of the face: he painted no portraits, and yet
every head is one. He selected the head as pourtraying
the character, and the character to suit the picture.
It is not the beauty of form, but the innate
connexion between mind and form which nature herself
has traced in making the face the mirror of the
mind which he stretched forth his hand to grasp. His
own portrait I therefore inquired after, to see if I
could recognise the man: it is painted by one of his
best pupils. I have already said that I have recognised
his “Isabella.” When I meet his “Patrician,”
I shall recognise him in like manner. When I saw
his own picture I was startled most; for it is the portrait
of one who of all living men has exhibited, in
the same qualities—that of judging of himself in reference
to his work—Lord Metcalfe. Ordinary men
resemble not their parents but their age. Extraordinary
men of every age are those who can preserve
their own likeness, and having a likeness of their
own to preserve, resemble each other.</p>

 “The Spanish artists usually endeavoured to produce an
exact imitation of material nature; <em>while the Italians aimed at,
and attained higher results</em>. The object of the Spaniards being
less difficult of attainment, the perfection with which they imitated
nature, passes conception. To that they devoted all the
energies of their genius; while you may search in vain in the
best productions of Italy,—not excepting the school of Venice,
one that most resembles the Spanish,—for anything approaching
their success in that respect.”—<span class="smcap">Wells’s</span>

<h4 class="h4head"><span class="allsmcap">PELEA DE NAVAJA.—THE OLD SPANISH SWORD.</span></h4>

<p class="p2">A Sevillian whom I was questioning about the frequent
assassinations, astonished me by denying that
there were any. “What you hear of,” said he, “as
murders are duels.” I objected the <em>knife</em>;—he said,
“Well, the knife; that is our weapon; we fence, we
do not stab; the duel has its laws, the weapon its
science.” I thought this must be a figurative manner
of describing some rude point of honour, and asked
him to show me in what consisted the science. “I
am not expert,” he said; “but if you are curious I
will take you to a friend of mine, whom you can
engage, as he is the best player in Seville; and,
since the death of Montez, in all Andalusia.”</p>

<p>I begged immediately to be conducted to the <i>yueçador</i>,
and was introduced to the inner apartment;
which—as he united the calling of contrabandist to that
of fencing-master—was filled with bales of tobacco.
The subject was broached as a matter of business. He
was willing to give me lessons, but would not undertake
to <em>teach</em> me. If I had natural dispositions I
might learn “to play” in three months, taking Time
by the forelock. I proposed commencing at once; and
next morning he came to me by day-light, at the inn—for
it required a large room. A wooden dagger is
used for a foil: it is about eight inches long, and in
form like the old sacrificial knife: it is held by the
closed fingers, the thumb stretching along the blade,
and the edge turned inward. Round the left arm is
wound the jacket as a shield. My teacher, putting
himself in attitude, at once reminded me of the fighting
Gladiator. He thus commenced: “You must hold
your right hand down upon your thigh; you must
never <em>raise it till sure of your blow</em>. Your feints must
be with the eye—the eye, hand and leg must move
together. When you look here, you must strike there,
and spring when you have cut, <i lang="es">corta y huya</i>. The
left arm must be kept high, the right hand low, the
knees bent, the legs wide, the toes forward, ready to
spring back or forward. There are three cuts and
three parries; one point,—the point is low and at the
belly—St. George’s <i lang="fr">au bas ventre</i>: the cut must be
across the muscle on the shoulder or the breast, or
down well into the groin, so as to let out the bowels.
Unless you know <em>how to cut</em>, it is of no use knowing
how to fence.”</p>

<p>He knew nothing of our fencing, and was much
surprised when I made application of it, and attributed
the advantages it gave to a natural instinct for
the art. The result was, that in a week he had gone
through the whole course, and the last day of my
stay at Seville, he brought two of the proficients, and
we had a regular <i lang="fr">assault d’armes</i>, the guests at the
hotels being spectators. He honoured me at the introduction
by saying, that he feared me more than
either of his two compeers, because I sprang better
than the one, and cut better than the other.</p>

<p>The attitudes are a study for an artist. There are
not the stiff figures and sharp angles of our fencing;
but the rounded limb, the gathered-up muscle, the
balanced body:—instead of the glance of the steel
there is that of the eye. The weapon is concealed
under the hand, and pointing down, so that not a
ray betokens it. There is no boxer’s fist or cestus,
no crusader’s helm or hauberk, no Roman’s sword or
shield. It seemed as if the hands and the eye of the
man were equal to the claw of the tiger, or the tusk
of the boar. It was a combat of beasts rather than a
contest of men. There was the ambling pace, the
slouching gait of the panther or the lion, or, rather, it
was a mixture of the snake and the frog; gliding like
the one and springing like the other. This is the war
<em>of</em> the knife, the <i lang="es">Pelea de Navaja</i>, falsely interpreted
war <em>to</em> the knife.</p>

<p>After missing a blow with the right hand, the knife,
by a dexterous player, may be jerked into the left; but
this, if unsuccessful, is inevitable death. To
jerk<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_335"></a><a href="#footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a></span> it
at your antagonist is not permitted by the rules of the
game. By a sudden spring an adversary’s foot may be
pinned after he has failed in a blow. The most deadly
of these feints is to strike the foot of your adversary
sideways and so bring him down. A celebrated Juccador
named Montes (not the <i lang="es">Torero</i>), killed in this
manner eleven men, and was at last so killed himself.</p>

<p>The mantle or jacket round the left arm is used, not
for the purpose of catching the blow, but of striking
off the adversary’s arm so that he may not reach.
The guarding arm is always within reach, but always
avoided; for to strike at it would leave your side open,
and the safety consists in keeping <em>under</em> your adversary.
The arms of the players were all scarred; but
that was in “love fights.” The edge of the knife is
then blunted, or a shoulder is put to it, as in the case
of the lances which they use with the bulls.</p>

<p>The Sevillian was right. This is not simple assassination:
it is not the stab given in the dark, though
of course we could only so understand a man being
killed by a knife. A popular song at Seville is, the
lamentation of a man imprisoned for “stabbing” another:—he
exclaims against the wrong; justifies his
legitimate defence of his <i>maja</i>; calls upon the gaoler
to testify to his treatment; and, failing to obtain
sympathy, rushes to the grates and appeals to the
people:—</p>

<p class="center" lang="es">“Si venga gente pora aca!”</p>

<p>There is no song sung with more fervour by the
ladies.</p>

<p>This is the most deadly weapon I know; the dirk,
the cama, the dagger, are grasped in the hand, and
impelled by the leverage of the arm. The navaja may
be so used, or plunged right on end like the Hindoo
dagger, and also by the motion of the wrist alone: it
more resembles mowing with the scythe than thrusting
with a poniard: it is accompanied by the action of
the sword, in which, as in fencing, the limbs come
into play, and thus serves the purpose of a defensive
weapon. It is the origin of our fencing; and against
adversaries not acquainted with that art, or not armed
for it, it still retains all its ancient superiority:—in
all cases it would be a valuable accessory to other
weapons, without being an incumbrance, and serving
for all the ordinary purposes of a knife.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i387.jpg"
 alt="navaja">
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>The navaja (pronounced <em>navakha</em>) is a clasp knife,—those
worn by professed players are a foot long when
closed. There is a spring to catch it behind, to prevent
it closing on the hand. When opened there is the
click as in cocking a pistol, and the sound is said to
delight Andalusian equally with Irish ears. The art
of fencing with it is called <i lang="es">pelea de navaja</i>. Pelea
has been derived from <ins title="pelea" lang="el">πελέα</ins>, or <ins title="pallos" lang="el">πάλλος</ins>, of the
Greeks; but I give it a higher origin. The Pelethites
and the Cerethites served in the armies of Judæa; and
though these were the names of two people, Hebrews
seem to have borne subsequently that name. One of
these passed into Greece as Cretan, and Creticus became
synonymous with bowman. The Pelethites,
doubtless, used some other weapon, and what it was
the <ins title="pelea" lang="el">πελέα</ins> of the Greeks and the Pelea of the
Spaniards plainly show. Not that the navaja came
from Judæa: the word is Basque, an original term
signifying to make smooth, as with a knife. Had
it belonged to the Iberi it would have been Etruscan
in all probability, and the Romans would not have
called it Spanish. Manlius Torquatus, indeed, used it
when the Romans had no connexion with Spain: so
that it was in Italy, and of course amongst the remnants
of the Siculi and Itali—if these, as I have supposed,
were the same as the Hispani. It must have
been preserved in the same manner as the Spanish cap
and shoes of which Seneca speaks.</p>

<p>The single combat between Manlius Torquatus and
the Gaul, occurred nearly two hundred years before the
Romans set foot in Spain. The appearance of this
barbarian in his armour appalled the Romans; and
the champion, when found prepared for the combat,
by laying aside his Roman armour, was armed by his
companions with other weapons. The historian describes
the combat as if—without understanding its
peculiar feature, <em>the mode of grasping the weapon</em>—he
were describing a <dfn>Palea de navaja</dfn>. “The Roman,”
says Livy, “held his sword close to the thigh, <em>with the
point raised</em>, getting under the Gaul’s shield, and too
close for the stroke of his long sword; he then with
a cut forwards and back, slit his belly and let out
his bowels.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_336"></a><a href="#footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a></span>
This would have been impracticable
with a sword held in the common manner, or with
the “mucrone surrecto:” thus held it would merely
have been plunged in; whereas it is the slicing
of the navaja that he describes in the wound it
made.</p>

<p>Livy, writing four hundred years after, explains in
the ordinary language, the use of an instrument with
which he was unacquainted. It may be objected that
a Roman must have been conversant with the sword
of a country with which the Romans had been so long
at war, but with our armies in Spain, with so many
military and scientific men, artists, and philosophers
studying its customs, the “Pelea di navaja” has not
been so much as noticed, even as a curiosity. Elsewhere
Livy says, that the Spanish sword was more
fitted to wound by its point than its edge: from its
shortness sprang their agility. This is incompatible
with the ancient sword, or modern fencing.</p>

<p>In the description of battles with the Spaniards,
the sword is never mentioned as a weapon used by
them, when attacking a heavy-armed body, or resisting
its attack. On more than one occasion their
defeat is attributed to their spears being broken,
when they would be expected to draw their swords:
no mention is made of their drawing swords, and
having only the “navaja” and spear. They could not
after the loss of the latter, stand against the united
mass of the legion with their short swords, nor
defend themselves against a charge of cavalry; but
they appear to have been superior, man to man,
to the Romans,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_337"></a><a href="#footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a></span>
as these were to the Greek phalangite.</p>

<p>It was not an exchange of one sword for another,
but adopting the Spanish knife as a supplementary
weapon. Machiavelli remarks, that by the distribution
of the Roman legion into three ranks, it had
three times to be beaten before a battle could be
won; and thus it would seem that it possessed three
kinds of weapons, and three manners of using them
to be employed before any one of the ranks could
be ultimately broken.</p>

<p>This explanation meets all the difficulties of the
case. The Spanish sword was adopted, yet the Roman
is not laid aside, nor are these two swords spoken of
conjointly. It accounts for the distinction between
sword and knife, and explains the Greek term, as
used by Polybius, and supports Dr. Arnold’s persuasion
that in latter times the Pelites had a sword. A sword
in the ordinary sense, they could not have had, for a
sword requires a long shield, and then constituted the
difference between the heavy and the light-armed.
The nature of their tactics made swords superfluous.
The Pelites advanced to skirmish and retreated through
the intervals of the maniples, and formed again behind
the legion. It was quite another thing to carry, as a
protection for their persons, the Spanish navaja.</p>

<p>I do not imagine that this “Spanish sword,” as
adopted by the Romans, was the clasp-knife. It is
likely that the model of it is preserved in the lath
foil still used in teaching, and which is the sacrificial
knife.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_338"></a><a href="#footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a></span>
No instrument can be better conceived
for ripping up the bowels of a man, or for cutting
the throat of an animal.</p>

<p>On my return to England, I was one day in the
room of the British Museum, when Mr. Warshaw,
of Copenhagen, brought some bronze instruments
from a Celtic cairn; one of these I at once recognized
as the “Spanish sword,” although the form was
new to me. Symptoms of incredulity, as was natural,
manifesting themselves, I asked the gentlemen
present to handle the weapon. It was tried all round,
and no one could grasp it so as to use it, in consequence
of a sharp-turned hook from the hilt which
prevented it from being held, either as a sword or
a dagger; but which left space for the points of the
fingers, as the Spaniards hold the navaja. I showed
it to be what I said it was, by taking hold of it in
the manner in which it had to be used. There
are now four at the British Museum: they are of
the Roman period, in bronze—in case 46, of the
Bronze-room. One of them is fitted to go into a
wooden socket, or handle, and is but one step from
the clasp-knife.</p>

<div class="figright">
 <img src="images/coin.jpg"

<p>Now at last, knowing what the Spanish sword was,
I looked to the coins, and found one of the Carisia
family, which, in the plates of Florey and Morel,
have, together with other armour, an instrument resembling
it. Fortunately, this coin is in the British
Museum: it is in beautiful preservation, and there
is the very weapon with the strange handle, which
had been discovered by Mr. Warshaw. Here it is
given as a Spanish weapon; and on the same coin
are the other two distinguishing arms of Spain, the
<i>Lance</i> and <i>Cetra</i>. The name of the former was taken
by the testimony of the Romans, from the Spaniard:
the second is mentioned as a Spanish weapon, and
Cæsar uses it as a distinguishing sign. The name
also is Spanish.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_339"></a><a href="#footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a></span>

<p class="p2">Fourteen days at Seville sparkled through their
course, but I neither counted hours nor felt fatigue.
Time seemed to stand still, though the greater and
lesser lights rose and set. In constant haste, yet in
unbroken abstraction, the diversity of objects seemed
to create fresh senses, and to feed exhausted strength.
I knew no sleep, but was in a dream that never broke
while I sojourned in this city—no, not city—this
sea-shore—this forest of cedars—Alhambra—Island
of the Cyclades—Vale of Tempe,—for such sort of
habitation is fitted for such golden memories.</p>

<p>Its marvels were many; its mysteries were one,
and that the dance. It was not the bolero of the
streets, or the ballet of the boards, but a dance of
reserve and tradition. I had not heard of it, and
went not in search of it;—it broke upon me, and
in a series of surprises.</p>

<p>“Would you like to see the Sevillian dances?”
was asked me in a whisper, and, assenting, I found
that it was no public performance to which I was
recommended or invited, but a representation, in
private, of dancers who did not appear on the
stage. My natural question was, “Are these dances
indecent?” The reply was,“No.” “Why, then,
are they not performed in public?” and the answer,
“The people would go mad.” I was told that they
might be seen but could not be described, and a
dancing-master would get the dancers and invite some
friends.</p>

<p>At the time appointed, I was conducted up a crazy
flight of stairs to a low-roofed room, some fifteen feet
by thirty, paved with square, coarse, and ill-laid tiles;
lighted with three or four common lamps, stuck in
the plastered walls. There was a narrow bench all
round, on which were seated men, women, and children
of homely appearance. Though called a ball,
none were to take part but the attired dancers—four
girls, one of them a child—all bespangled and bedizened
in white and pink, in satins and flowers. In
Spain no preparation has to be made for music: the
Greeks dance <ins title="meta stoma" lang="el">μετὰ στόμα</ins>, “with the mouth;” the
Spaniards dance with mouth and palm, or castanet,
which, if not in the dancer’s hand, vibrates in those
of the spectators: they beat time with their hands
and sing the choruses. Our music consisted of a single
guitar. I was not without suspicions and misgivings
respecting the nature of the performance; but although
there was in the decked girls that conscious
slouching gait of a wild animal that has a nature
of its own, the gloom of the place, the meanness of
the apartment, and the ungainly aspect of the morose
assembly, discouraged the expectations that had
been raised, and I would gladly have retreated.</p>

<p>The twang of the guitar was heard, the space
cleared, and two of the dancers were balancing their
bodies and wreathing their arms, and retreat was impossible.
But it only was the fandango—no dexterity
to astonish, no excesses to shock, no blandishments to
seduce.</p>

<p>The fandango done, a <dfn>mesclo</dfn> succeeded—a sort of
olla podrida or ballet, composed of gallegada, back
to back, the Hola Aragonese, the seguadilla marchega
with its strathspey time and step; the couples setting
to each other, and the Highland snap and shout.
This, too, was decorous, and I began to wonder what
all the mystery had been about, and when would arise
the madness we were to witness, and perchance to share.</p>

<p>The assembly had gradually fired—that fluid power
which matter will, by motion, engender: the dancers
gathered and discharged, and shock by shock the spectators
vibrated to their motion, and trembled with
their pulse. As speech is not teeth or tongue, but
all the features; so is the dance not legs, but all
the figure. We indeed look out on it by the eyes
alone, and are pleased to be surprised with an effort,
charmed with an attitude, enchanted by a form.
There is here nothing of the sort, nor is it an “epic.”
There is no “poem:” there may be a story; there
is poetry; but it is neither our pantomime nor our
ballet, any more than it is our zephyr groups or <dfn>poses</dfn>.
These constitute our dancing, and if I were conveying
my impressions by word of mouth, I would pause
here, nor proceed until we had got at all the sources
of gratification, which we either experience from dancing,
or conceive to belong to it. Then I could show
that the dance in Spain calls into play another set
of nerves. Its fascination may be exerted without
beauty, agility, or grace. Now I knew that ours was
only prose, for I had learned metre.</p>

<p>With us the limbs move hither or thither, lifting
the body about; the triumph of art is to veil the
mechanism. The limbs are indeed exposed in their
outline, but our ideal would be achieved if the body
were to appear to rise and descend without their aid.
The Spanish dance is an inward action; the limbs
only manifest it. It is deep as a fountain—now
sealed, and still now bubbling up with tremulous
motion; now overflowing in devious courses, now
bursting forth in wild contortions, then arrested, and
returning to its source. Gesture is its voice, movement
its sound: it fills the air, settles on the
beholder: it is felt not seen, and might be perceived
with the eyes shut, if you could but close
them. The ecstacies it produces, and which astound
the stranger by their vehemence and delicacy—by
a frenzy that has rules, and a passion that glows
but does not burn, arises from this, that the performance
is not witnessed but shared. Compared to
our dancing, it is as expression to grimace—the living
countenance to a pasteboard mask. The Spanish—no,
the Iberian—the Phrygian—dancer before me
sought not to float in air: she belonged to earth, and
envied neither the bird his wing, nor the cloud its
texture. She could pause, stand, stamp, plant herself—then
defy. This is no part pantomime, but all
dance: the earth, not the air, was her element: it
was to her what it is to the wrestler, to the statue,
to the antelope, to the tree.</p>

<p>But I anticipate.—What I have said was suggested
by two dances which were reserved—the <dfn>ole</dfn> and the
<dfn>beto</dfn>, and which are no more to be conceived by the
fandango, than that is by a <i lang="fr">pas de fascination</i> in a
ballet. Borrowing a hat—the Spanish broad-brimmed,
high-peaked, festooned hat—the dancer places it on
her head, tosses and shifts it; beats with her foot,
toe, heel; squares her arms: as a snake’s, her body
undulates: she looks round, watches, tosses her head
again, snorts, sniffs the air. Is it instinct—is it passion—is
it a foe—is it a rival? will she fly—will she
charge—are they weapons she prepares, or charms?</p>

<p>That figure, which at the distance of the remote
seats of a theatre, would have appeared motionless and,
by its grotesque attire, might have awakened merriment—has
now riveted every glance. The guitar’s
tones partake of the disorder, and give forth—so to
speak—a sympathetic provocation. She starts, wavers,
selects, and springs upon her foe. It is the bull in the
arena! One by one, she runs at Picador and Chulo,
falters, swerves, and runs upon another. Peals of merriment
follow each feint. When her choice is fixed, the
contortions, as she approaches, subside, the limbs are
subdued, defiance changes to fascination, and the bull
becomes the woman. A handkerchief is spread on
the ground as she advances: she places her foot on
it; stooping, the knee is bent; she pauses, then
slightly raising the heel, moves it to and fro, while
pinching, with forefinger and thumb, the bosquina at
the knee, and lifting it twice or thrice. Heads and
shoulders press forward to witness this ceremony, and
as she bounds away, hats and jackets are cast upon
the ground, amidst a burst of intoxication, and a
chorus of “Salero! Salero!” whilst the happy swain,
the object of these attentions, gathers up the handkerchief,
on which her foot has been placed, and
treasures its dust in his bosom.</p>

<p>Here is a history—here are rites and rules, mysteries
to me and to themselves. It was the bull, but it
was something more too. Is it the horned Isis or
the Minotaur? But the <dfn>ludus</dfn> did not end here.
After skipping around and between, and avoiding or
sparing the <dfn>sombreros</dfn>
(hats),<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_340"></a><a href="#footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a></span>
she suddenly rushed
at one of them, and,—what shall I say?—<em>gored it</em>;—she
sprang upon, and pounded it with her feet—left
it—returned to it again, to toss the prostrate
foe: approaching its owner, her victim, as the bull,—as
the woman, taking from her head the hat which
she had worn, and crowning him with it—“King of
the lists.” This was the <i lang="fr">dénouement</i> of the dance—or
game, or ceremony, or orgy, or myth, or combat—call
it which you will.</p>

<p>“Salero” thrilled through me. The interpretation
was unknown. It is inexplicable, and like the “hugmeneh”
of the Highlands—the Phrygian cry of which
I had found in Barbary the interpretation—of what
could “salero”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_341"></a><a href="#footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a></span>
remind one, if not the <i>Salii</i>?</p>

<p>That the motions of animals should have suggested
primitive dances is but natural; and what animal
could more entrance the Spanish spirit than the bull?
It is not a passion of yesterday: we have the bullring
on early Etruscan vases. I have since found a
confirmation of this idea in the dances of New Holland
so striking, that I subjoin a description from
an eye-witness.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_342"></a><a href="#footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a></span></p>

<p>In contrasting Spanish and European dancing, I
have put gesture aside, as no part of the former;
but, in fact, we have no gesture. There is more in
the turn of a gipsy’s head, and the wave of her
arm, than in all the practising of the ballerinas.</p>

<p>The Andalusians have a peculiar manner of rendering
“the body’s gait.” They say, “<cite>Aire e meneo</cite>;”
the nearest approach to which is, “air and mien:”
but the nearer the words the farther the sense;—meneo
(from <dfn>meneh</dfn>, the Sabæan festival,) is not our
processional gait, but the cadenced flow of the long
and graceful line as it undulated over strewed flowers,
between lifted palms and burning censers.</p>

<p>The Reformation is attributed to the study of the
classics. The classics themselves must have been still
more rational. How, then, did the old worship stand
so long, shamed by the life of the Christian, and
stained by the blood of the martyr? The world then
was neither devout nor ignorant: the sceptic taught
in the schools, the scoffer entered the sanctuary. The
phenomenon was now explained, or rather—comprehending
somewhat of the spell which bound the senses
of Greek and Roman—I perceived the problem by the
solution. Seeing what dancing could be, even as divested
of all pomp, circumstance, and honour, I could
imagine what in all its branches must have been that
religion of art, that “worship of the beautiful,” which
we hold at once to be the glory and the shame of
Greece.</p>

<p>We only understand vice as the antagonist of Christianity:
assailed by vice, it was itself the assailant
of “art;”—thus did Mars and Jupiter reign long as
statues, if not as gods.</p>

<p>But an esthetic life of sentiment was not alone
engendered. These excellences were part of the institutions
of the land. The songs of Tyrtæus had
their chorus; from the games of Elis the Greeks repaired
to Marathon, nor had they lost the Pyrrhic
phalanx, had they saved the Pyrrhic dance. The
interval is not great with the patriarchs and worthies
of Israel. What would sound more Pagan, if we
listened for the sense, than David dancing before
the ark? We read it with an awkward feeling—half
ridicule, half reproach.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_343"></a><a href="#footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a></span>
It is we who have
reduced the dance to an amusement, or an exhibition;
we have chased away every thought not
trivial or mercenary; we have left to it no occasion
to be grave, and suffer it in no ceremony that is
solemn. Nowhere, but here, is there a rent in that
heavy veil, which has for nearly two thousand years
shrouded the memory of that wonderful union of the
harmonies of sound and gesture, which was the charm
of the ancient world.</p>

<p>The descriptions of mythological ceremonies, the
investigation of ancient history, the turning over the
pages of poets for seductive images, the pacing of
galleries for noble forms, the indulging in the reveries
of the sea-shore, or the mountain-side—all these could
not furnish what that Sevillian room, floored with
brick, supplied.</p>

<p>Seville preserves the Hebrew ceremony as well as
the Pagan orgy. On the Saturday evening before
Easter, and during the following se’nnight, a dance
is performed in front of the high altar, by youths
in the old Spanish dress, sky-blue satin and white
muslin, high-crowned hat of blue, with a white and
flowing plume. The music of the cathedral is replaced
by an orchestra, by the rails of the altar. The
dancers are seated facing each other, on each side
the altar. The music of the cathedral ceases. After
a pause, the band of worldly instruments strikes up
a valtz or a cachouca; presently the voices of the boys
join; then they start to their legs. The song is a
lyric composition: they sing and dance together,
moving solemnly through a variety of figures. The
music is in two or three metres, like the Greek chorusses.
The first act completed, they return to their
seats. The second is more animated, for by word of
command they place their hats on their heads, and then
the rattling of the castanets, which hitherto have been
silent and concealed in their hands, is heard through
the aisles, and this terminates a performance solemn
and impressive to the Andalusian, which to our ideas
would be nothing short of sacrilege or insanity.</p>

<p>In the midst of another scene—a bull-fight—the
dance is thus described by M. Quinet:—“Scarcely
had the mules dragged out the carcasses, when the
sound of castanets was heard; the barrier was opened
again, and a long train of dancers entered, divided
into groups according to the provinces of Spain:
each wore the costume of their own province: the
Basque with long flowing hair upon their shoulders;
the Valencians (half Arabs) with a plaid; the Catalonians
with their large embroidered belt; the Aragonese
with their dark mantles; but the most brilliant
and gorgeous are the Andalous, with their large hats
and light jackets, embroidered in a thousand colours,
and with intermingled points of steel. The troop
pass along with pomp; the people gaze on them
with pride; and on the still warm and bloody earth
the dance commences. The fandango and bolero
balance each other with a characteristic monotony,
recalling the noble simplicity of the ancient vases.
From carelessness to gravity; from gravity to languor;
from languor to intoxication and the exhaustion
of passion. There is the moment at which
the whole assembly is struck. Each Andalous dancer
stoops to the earth, as if to gather flowers for the
head of his partner, and immediately after he leans his
head upon his hand, his elbow on the shoulder of the
Andalusian—and he remains immoveable. I know not
if this is one of the ordinary features of the dance, or
if it was a sudden thought; but this single movement
seized instantaneously the ten thousand spectators:
they rose at once, and a burst of enthusiasm came
forth such as I have never before heard. There was
not one man of the people who did not feel to the bottom
of his soul this poetry without words; and all
the provinces of Old Spain were again confounded
together in that instant. The crowd disappeared and
I remained alone in the vast amphitheatre, fixed to my
seat. This mixture of murder and of grace—of enchantment,
of carnage, and of dance, have left me
overwhelmed with stupor: I still see this blood, these
smiles, these horrible gashes and odious agonies, the
thrill of the fandango, and that Andalusian that stops
to dream.”</p>

<p>Of what other country of Europe could such things
be written? To admire or to comprehend is quite
enough at one time; and it is seldom that we can at
once enjoy both these gratifications. Let those who
can admire Spain be content, nor spoil that pleasure
by the hopeless attempt to comprehend her.</p>

 When I asked the meaning of it, all they could say, was,
that it meant “salt.” Mr. A. Dumas, who has given, if not an
accurate description of the dance, at least a vivid delineation of
his own sensations, has, from thinking salero to be nonsense,
written <i lang="es">salado</i>, and makes the performers be gratified by being
called “<i lang="fr">très salées</i>.” He is the only writer who has published
this mystery.</p>

<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_342"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_342"><span class="muchsmaller">[342]</span></a>
 “After rest and refreshment, they began another dance, in
which a portion of them, taking tufts of grass in their mouths,
imitated the actions of the kangaroo. After quietly feeding and
hopping about for a while like the kangaroos, they were followed
by the rest of the party, who in their real characters began to
creep after the kangaroos to surprise them. The ludicrous
bounds and manœuvres of pursuit and escape were quite astonishing,
and the act ended by the pretence of putting one of the
representatives of the captured kangaroos on the fire to be roasted.
This they called the kangaroo dance: they then gave us the
 emu dance, in which—with one arm raised to form the neck of
the bird, the hand twisted to represent the head—with the
body stooped, they went through all the actions of this bird, and
with the most amazing effect.”</p>

<p class="footnote">“I asked the king what this dance meant, and he pointed to
the moon then full above our head, and said, ‘good to black
fellow.’ No doubt he would have proceeded to acknowledge that
the ceremony was in honour of the moon, had not one of the
others who had stood his grog better than king Caboa, stepped
up and said, ‘New Zealandman’s dance.’ He meant the name to
mislead, for they are very secret in all their religious ceremonies.”</p>

<h3 class="h3head"><a id="chap5_6"></a>CHAPTER <abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr></h3>

<h4 class="h4head"><span class="allsmcap">THE ARCHITECTURE OF CANAAN AND MOROCCO.</span></h4>

<p class="p2">What we consider in architecture is form or order.
The masonry of Rome and her teachers, the Etruscans,
of the Pelasgi, the Cyclopes, the Druids, and the
Egyptians, present us with colossal and imperishable
monuments. These depend entirely on mathematical
principles and mechanical adjustments, because stone
alone was used, nor have we any idea of another
manner of building. There was, however, still another
race than these, which delighted in lofty towers
and massive walls, who, without stones, built Babel
and Babylon.</p>

<p>The first point in architecture is, therefore, the
material, and by that originally used must its subsequent
forms and order have been established.
We have, indeed, kept this primary condition in
view, and carried our application of it to the most
extravagant excess. The cave of the Trogloditæ,
the timber origin of the Hindoo, Ancient Persian,
and the Greek, the essentially rock origin of the
Cyclopic, have been fully illustrated; and applying
our rule in every case whence we had not a natural
original, we created it. We have caused the Gothic
to spring out of the interlacing branches of the
forests of the North.
Warburton<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_344"></a><a href="#footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a></span> was, I think, the
first who put forward this extravagance, supporting
it by historical suggestions which consisted in anachronisms;
but the same proposition recurs over and
over again, as it furnishes a theme for that sort of
stilted composition which has become the staple of the
recent trade of book-making on
art.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_345"></a><a href="#footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a></span></p>

<p>Architecture moulds itself into the shapes of things
in use <em>for building</em>; it does not copy the independent
works of nature. The column and entablature, the
volute, abacus and plinth, are imitations in stone
of the woodwork of primitive huts; they are not
copies of the growing tree. The origin of the Gothic
is still to find; an earlier material than stones is
to be looked for; and if we would go back to the
origin, we must figure to ourselves the art of building
as devised for defence, before descending to embellishments,
or to the lowly habitations out of which
those temples arose, which have been distributed into
and constitute the five orders of architecture.</p>

<p>The Arameans, the elder branch of the human
family and the inheritors of early light, first occupied
and permanently retained that fertile and well-watered
region, which lies between the great limbs
of the earth and the subdivisions of the ocean.
There, neither strong positions were to be found,
nor stones to be procured for the construction of
defences. Their very existence depended upon the
invention of a process by which the earth itself
could be converted into walls. The soil containing a
large proportion of alumine, durable walls might be
made from it without the aid of any art, save that
of beating and ramming down. Factitious stones
might be obtained, or the mass formed at once by
cases into a wall. Against injury from rain they
had ready to their hand a preservative, in the bitumen
with which the country abounded, and with
which they cemented the bricks and besmeared the
walls.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_346"></a><a href="#footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a></span></p>

<p>These walls, whether made in pieces (brick) or in
blocks, were however soft and perishable without the
aid of fire, which gives brick (burnt) and lime two
compositions, of which, like air and water, we do not
know the value, by enjoying constantly their use.
These discoveries I imagine to have been connected
with the sacrifice as practised by the early Arameans.
The Jews were forbidden to make an altar of stone,
and when they set up stones, they were forbidden
to raise on them a tool of
<em>iron</em>.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_347"></a><a href="#footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a></span>
They were, moreover,
ordered to make the altar of
<em>earth</em>,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_348"></a><a href="#footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a></span>
and traces
of this practice are to be found elsewhere, as among
the Phrygians<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_349"></a><a href="#footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a></span>
and the Greeks.</p>

<p>The varieties of soil would thus expose to the fire,
in various combinations, alumine, silex, carbonate
and sulphate of lime (selenite). The blood flowed
on it, and—as in the case of Jupiter Olympius—it was
plastered over with the ashes. In the alluvial plains
of Mesopotamia, these altars must have been of brick
in the mountainous districts, where alabaster as well
as limestone abounded—gypsum and lime. At once
would the substance of plaster be known, and the
manner of using it, and, probably, lime was similarly
treated, and thence the strength of ancient mortar.
Vitruvius directs it to be mixed with
ashes,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_350"></a><a href="#footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a></span> as it
must have been in the plastering of these earth-altars.</p>

<p>Having thus obtained lime, it was used as the discovery
suggested that it should be; that is, to harden
the earth-walls themselves—not to cement stones.
They would soon discover that gypsum had to be set
up in moulds, hardening at once of its own accord;
but that lime, mixing with the earth, or with gravel,
acquired consistency by being rammed down. The
varieties so presented are infinite, from the rudest,
the cheapest, and the most perishable walls, to the
most costly and durable ramparts; and these could
so be raised without machinery or science, yet
affording a strength to resist the besieging operators
of those times, of a height to surpass all means of
assault, and of a durability that has defied Time itself.
The Devonshire cobwalls and the Normandy pisé afford
examples of the first;—common earth bound together,
in default of lime, with chopped straw; while in the
old Moorish tower of Gibraltar is a specimen of the
last, a concrete possessing greater power of resistance
to shot than any discovery which has been made since
the introduction of artillery.</p>

<p>When I first saw the ruins of the Phœnician city
of old Tangier, which is a rough-looking wall (the
<i lang="la">opus incertum</i> of the Romans), such as might be
built by a very rude people in our times, I could
not believe it to be Phœnician; but upon further
examination of such ruins, and when I came to consider
the nature of the soil where these structures
were raised, and the merit attached to the first application
of this most important material—<em>lime</em>—I found
in that very coarseness an evidence of the high antiquity
of these walls, and of the ingenuity of this
people; and felt that we were indebted to them for
a substance become of primary necessity.</p>

<p>A captive, employed as the Jews in Egypt were,
has thus described the task of the Christian slaves
in Morocco:</p>

<p>“Our work and daily labour was continually building
of houses and walls: the material and method
is so very foreign, and will appear strange to my
countrymen. Here there are boxes of wood, of dimensions
according to pleasure: these we fill with earth
powdered, and lime and gravel well beat together
and <em>tempered with water</em>; and when full, we remove
the box according to order, and withdraw the box
planks, and leave this matter to dry, which will then
acquire an incredible degree of hardness and is very
lasting, for we have seen walls of some hundred years’
standing, as we are informed, and all that time has
not been able to do them any prejudice. The king
himself (what reason for his humour may be we
never had the curiosity to ask him) will sometimes
vouchsafe to work in the lime and dirt for an hour
together, and will bolt out an encouraging word
to the slaves there, viz., as I remember, 'God send
you to your own countries;’ but I judge he either
does not speak from his heart, or else he hopes God
will not answer the prayer of such a wretch as
himself.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_351"></a><a href="#footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a></span></p>

<p>Livy mentions the Wall of Saguntum as similarly
constructed; and Pliny speaks of the “forms” which
they used for ramming down the materials in constructing
them. He confines the practice to Mauritania
and Spain. In these two countries it has still
one and the same name, <dfn>Tapia</dfn>. In Hebrew and
in Egyptian <dfn>teb</dfn> is the word which we translate
“brick;” it also signifies “box.” The name has been
derived from the mould. The hieroglyphic for <dfn>teb</dfn> is
a foot and a hand.</p>

<p>No doubt from this word the name of the great
city of Egypt, Thebes, is derived. I am aware that
Sir Gardnor Wilkinson derives it from <dfn>ap</dfn>, or <dfn>ape</dfn>,
meaning the head or capital of the country; but
<dfn>tab</dfn> is much nearer to Thebes than <dfn>ap</dfn> or <dfn>ape</dfn>;
and I am not aware that any city ever received its
name from the head; whereas the most common of
etymons for cities—at least among Arameans, is the
defences which distinguish them from the inhabitants
of the Tents.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_352"></a><a href="#footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a></span></p>

<p>The derivatives from this word are extraordinary
from their number, and the languages through which
they spread, and vouch for the importance of the object
to which it was applied, and the antiquity of the
language in which it was used. The Turkish has taken
from it its word for <em>fortress</em>—“<dfn>tabia</dfn>,”—and for <dfn>mound</dfn>,—“<dfn>tepe</dfn>.”
The Arabic preserves it in its pure sense—the
Spanish derives from it <dfn>tapar</dfn> to close, and <dfn>tapeti</dfn>
a covering;—whence in the French we have <dfn>taper</dfn> and
<dfn>tapis</dfn>;—in English we have <dfn>tapestry</dfn>, <dfn>tap</dfn>, which has
been probably derived from the original <dfn>teb</dfn>; we
have<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_353"></a><a href="#footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a></span>
<dfn>tub</dfn> and <dfn>tube</dfn>. The Greeks have taken from
it <ins title="typos" lang="el">τύπος</ins>, and thence <ins title="typtô" lang="el">τύπτω</ins>; whence the string of
European derivatives, <dfn>type</dfn>, <dfn>typify</dfn>, &amp;c., <ins title="tapeinos" lang="el">ταπεινὸς</ins>,
humble, <i>i.e.</i> beaten down; also, <ins title="taphos" lang="el">ταφὸς</ins>, tomb, from
the association of this mode of building with that of
tombs.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_354"></a><a href="#footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a></span></p>

<p>About the time that the Hebrews were taking Jericho,
the Phœnicians were carrying on their commercial
enterprises to the west. By this irruption into
Canaan, an immense mass of colonists was placed at
their disposal; and to this event in all probability is to
be attributed the number and importance of their settlements.
They are supposed to have reached the
Northern Ocean, and especially to have had their settlements
in Britain, as is indeed proved by the names
still preserved in Devonshire and Cornwall. In those
two counties the <dfn>tapia</dfn> of Morocco is still used in
building, though the species is of that inferior order in
which lime is not used; or if used at all, merely for
the coating—the tempering with lime of Ezekiel. In
deriving it from the Phœnicians, difficulty presents
itself in the name: it is called <dfn>cob</dfn>:—this word is
neither Teutonic, nor Celtic, Greek, nor Latin, Hebrew
nor Arabic. It was after long research that the origin
of it occurred to me in a word that I was in the daily
habit of using, and which is the common name given
in Morocco to a tomb—which is Cubbe. Many English
derivatives show that <dfn>cob</dfn> meant both “wall” and
“beating.” <dfn>Cobweb</dfn>, the web and the wall; <dfn>cobden</dfn>,
hole in the wall; <dfn>cobler</dfn>, one making frequent use of
the hammer; <dfn>cobbing</dfn>, a school-boy term for thrashing
with a knotted handkerchief, besides many others—<dfn>Cobbett</dfn>—<dfn>Cobham</dfn>,—<dfn>cob</dfn>
as applied to a breakwater—Lyme <dfn>cob</dfn>.</p>

<p>Cubbe designates indeed a tomb; but it might
equally be rendered, building, or wall: for the cubbe
are the only buildings which appear throughout the
Western regions of Africa. Although the word will be
found in no Arabic dictionary, it is not likely that
<dfn>cob</dfn>, the Devonshire name for the material from
which the Moorish cubbe is built, should have been
given by mere chance. As the dictionary affords no
clue, we must endeavour to trace them back constructively.</p>

<p>Bochart accounts for the story of a tomb of Hecuba,
in Sicily, by supposing that the Greeks, seeing some
Phœnician tomb, and inquiring what the building was,
were answered, “<span class="smcap">Beth Hacub</span>, <dfn>suprema domus</dfn>.” The
meaning of Beth they could not mistake, and Hacub
could only be the unhappy consort of Priam. Sir
W. Hamilton does justice to this explanation in a rigid
criticism of the author. If Beth Hacub were so employed,
the contraction to the last syllable is quite
natural; and as the tombs in Britain would be built
of Tapia, the natives would call that substance by the
same name—Cub—cob; as the Phœnicians themselves
may have contracted it. The contraction has remained
in Britain applicable to walls when built of
this material—in Africa to the tombs which are their
buildings.</p>

<p>As each promontory in Sicily had its fable connected
with a tomb, the interpretation of which forms one of
the most interesting chapters of “<cite>Pheleg</cite>,” the tomb
must have been, as here now, the feature of the landscape.
The figure, at once the most simple and complex—the
cube, the dome, the arch, and spandril, all combined,
doubtless has remained unchanged. Such, then,
were those tombs scattered through Greece, and which
we hear of as “Phrygian,” a people which I think I
shall be able to prove to be identical with the ancient
inhabitants of Morocco; and to them Solon must have
referred when he forbade tombs to be built with
“<em>arched roofs</em>.”</p>

<p>The dominant form is the cube; but this is the very
word! It has been attempted to derive cube from
Caaba. Here is a distinction without a
difference.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_355"></a><a href="#footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a></span>
From the Greek <ins title="kybos" lang="el">κύβος</ins> we have the term all the way
downwards in every western language. Thus, the
building has supplied the general name to Europe
for its figure, to Devonshire for its substance, and
in Morocco has remained with its primitive meaning,
substance and figure.</p>

<p>The mistranslation of the Greeks respecting Hecuba,
receives a curious confirmation from a grotesque mistake
of the French: they call these buildings <dfn>marabouts</dfn>,
and speak and write about <dfn>marabouts</dfn> as if it
really were either an Arabic or a French name for
Cubbe.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_356"></a><a href="#footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a></span>
Marabouts are men, and they are sometimes
honoured with such a
tomb.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_357"></a><a href="#footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a></span>
The Greeks, hearing the
name of the building, applied it to a supposed inmate;
the French, being told the name of the inmate, applied
it to the edifice.</p>

<p>Pisé evidently comes from
<ins title="piezô" lang="el">πιέζω</ins>,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_358"></a><a href="#footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a></span> to squeeze or
break; and the Phoceans, the allies of the Phœnicians,
monopolised the commerce of Gaul. It is to
be inferred that Cob is Phœnician; but the word is
at present unknown, nor are there traces of it in
the ancient language.</p>

<p>Moors, like the Jews, as shown in Ezekiel’s parable,
“temper” the earth with lime. The durability
depends upon the amount of beating, and the quantity
of lime; and the expense is, of course, in proportion.
No ancient buildings of mere earth remain;
but still in Africa, though rarely, earth alone is used:
in one very important portion of their architecture
the three methods are all employed together, namely,
earth—earth and lime mixed, and pure lime. This
is for the flat roofings of their houses, and is a
matter of the greatest difficulty; in fact, the very
word architecture is derived from the process of roofing;
and they celebrate the covering-in of the houses
with ceremonies analogous to those which we employ
in laying the foundation stone. Over the wood-work
earth is first beaten down, then a layer of earth and
lime, and then the pure lime: each layer is separately
beaten. They use a small paviour’s mallet:
they work by gangs, and strike in cadence with short
stroke, singing in concert, and producing a strange
melody, that resounds through the neighbourhood
of their silent cities, startling the echoes with a melancholy,
but not unpleasing note, which recalls the
tones of “Adria’s gondolier;” but the words convey
simpler thoughts, and a more devotional spirit. One
strain runs thus:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i1">“Yalla wo yalla amili dinu yarbi;</div>
<div class="i1">Yalla wo yalla an azziz yarbi.”</div>

<div class="i1">O God! O God! Dear to me art thou, O my Lord!</div>
</div><!--end poem-->

<p>They also apply their incantation to the case, as
it may be. The traveller in Spain is often greeted
by a change in the metre and words of the song,
and the salutation is conveyed in their simple and pleasing
extempore verse. The owner of a house visiting
the work may in like manner be welcomed with
such a strain as this:</p>

<p>The distinction between the Aramean and the other
primitive races seems to have been maintained for
a couple of thousand years; but at the mixture of
nations by the great conquests of the Macedonians
and the Romans, we find the use of lime extending
to the others, and the chiseled stones adopted by
the Arameans. It is in the works of the western
or Moorish branch that has been preserved the type
to our day; and they have excelled all other people
in the grandeur and durability of their military architecture;
and, with the exception of the polygonal
and cyclopic, they have embodied with their own
every species of ancient
building.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_359"></a><a href="#footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a></span></p>

<p>We thus identify with the Arameans, block walls,
plaster of Paris, bricks and lime; and while it is
to be expected that these various processes should
be carried by them whither they emigrated, or taught
by them to the people among whom they established
colonies, or whom they instructed in the arts and
sciences, still are we not to look for these as combined
in one general system, but as severally or partially
adopted according to the character of the surface
of the country, or the nature of its soil, or as associated
with the kinds of masonry already in use.
In one country, however, the whole of the processes
which I have noticed are still to be found. Not
one is wanting; and they still possess that excellence
of early structure which we have lost in Europe.
In the villages round Tangier the walls are built of
sunburnt brick exactly of the shape and dimensions
of those of Babylon.</p>

<p>We have united in the origin as one whole,
thick tapia walls, lofty towers, and tesselated pavements.
Pliny mentions the introduction of the tesselated
pavement after the third Punic war. The
Greeks had before them employed pavements; and
this word which we associate with
stone<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_360"></a><a href="#footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a></span> comes
from <dfn>pavire</dfn>, to ram down, and could have no reference
to stone, but must have been the tapia of
Canaan.</p>

<p>When these artificers removed to countries where
the soil was no longer aluminous, they would doubtless,
although there were stones to build with, cling
to their own fashion, as their buildings and the apertures
would of necessity depend, not on the adjustment
of the blocks, but on the adhesion of the walls.
They clung also to their lofty towers even when they
could build on strong and naturally defensible positions.
Thus we find the Jews gratified by being permitted to
build lofty towers, and these have been the work of
predilection of the sovereigns of Morocco and of Spain.</p>

<p>This ramming into cases explains also the rectangular
forms of all their buildings: round towers
are very ancient and very Eastern: those of the Hindoo
were round. The primeval architecture, still preserved
in Sardinia, delighted in round towers, so also
those of Ireland were round. The vitrified
forts<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_361"></a><a href="#footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a></span>
were round, so that this form distinguishes the Arameans
from the Hindoos on the East, the Celts on
the North, and the Aboriginal population of Europe
on the West. The early Mussulmans borrowed in
the minaret the Minar of the Persians, but in the
<i>Sma</i><span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_362"></a><a href="#footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a></span>
of Barbary the original form was maintained.
The two are seen struggling and combined in the
mosques of Cairo, as in the early cathedrals of Europe.
In Morocco bricks are used of all the shapes, and in
all the varieties in which we find them in the East.
At Carteia I found the grooved bricks of Ancient
Arabia. Plaster of Paris is in like manner used for
building; and in Suez large portions of the houses
are set up at once, cast in moulds; and, lastly, there
is the block wall in all its varieties, from the earth
rammed to the concrete of mortar and earth, and of
mortar and stones, exactly like that which, constructed
two or three thousand years ago, still stands
as fresh as upon the day of erection. In fact, these
block walls are to-day as perfectly Moorish as the
horse-shoe arch, the arabesque ornament, or the
haïk.</p>

<p>The reason assigned by Herodotus for the selection
of brick by Asychis, the successor of Mycerinus,
for building his pyramid—namely, that it was more
honourable than granite, as showing the power of earth,
has occasioned in our times no small astonishment,
and has received no explanation. After what I have
said the explanation will be self-evident; and it is
not absolutely decided whether these structures were
raised by princes of Egyptian or Semetic blood. I
think that the
inscription<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_363"></a><a href="#footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a></span> and the story go further
than any positive statements of the Greek historian
could have gone to give a shepherd origin to them.</p>

<p>When the Hebrews returned to Canaan, the first
obstacle they met with was the walls of Jericho, an
obstacle such as to baffle their natural means and
acquired skill; nor is it to be supposed that they
were destitute of the means of attacking such defences;
but the walls of Jericho were remarkable in
a country of walled
towns,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_364"></a><a href="#footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a></span>
and the name of “moon,”
which Jericho signified, might have reference to their
height,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_365"></a><a href="#footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a></span>
which a special interposition was required
to overthrow. The Jews built with stones, and with
enormous ones, as the siege of Jerusalem and ruins
still extant attest; and they had also, as well as
the Canaanites, burnt bricks. David burnt the Ammonites
in their own kilns<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_366"></a><a href="#footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a></span>
at Rabbah. Ezekiel says,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_367"></a><a href="#footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a></span>
“And one built up a wall, and, lo, others daubed it
with untempered mortar. Say unto them which
daub it with untempered mortar, that it shall fall.
There shall be an overflowing shower.” These words
have to us no meaning, but they prove that building
in tapia or cob was the common practice of
Judæa.</p>

<p>The great event in the early history of the Jews
is the Egyptian captivity. The representatives of the
Arameans were here in contact with the most remarkable
builders of the other races. The task of the
Jews was building: it was not masonry—it was not
hewing in quarries or adjusting blocks, but building
with earth: the expression used in Scripture may be
interpreted as applying either to small or larger case-bricks,
or entire walls. In the Egyptian paintings
we see Jews<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_368"></a><a href="#footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a></span>
or Arameans occupied in the performance
of their task, and the red men, the Egyptians,
the task-masters over them. Here, however, it is
burnt bricks we see: the clay is weighed, beaten
into moulds, carried to the furnace blue, and brought
back red. The Jews, therefore, had introduced this
method. The soil of Egypt was not adapted for the
block wall or sun-burnt brick, whilst the silex fitted
it for burning.</p>

<p>Thus having got the materials, let us see how they
were used in the construction of their ordinary dwellings.
The Greek Triclinium-room was copied by the
Romans. The Moors have also a form of room, but
the method is different. The Greek house, as the
Turkish, was a variable aggregate of integers, which
were invariable. No light came from the door or
from the side in which it was, and by which the
room adjoined to the body of the house. From the
side opposite to the door—that is the top—came the
light from contiguous windows, as in the oriel windows
of the Middle Ages. The rooms were, therefore,
struck out to catch the light, and the house was
like a bunch of crystals, united at the base, no
account being taken, in building it, of the exterior
form, which depended on the accidental arrangement
and size of the rooms, the proportions of which were
invariable.</p>

<p>With the Moors it is exactly the reverse. Their
building was a square of dead walls: the rooms were
made to fit that form, and their light came by the
door and the door alone: the door is in the length
of the room, and divides it into two equal parts.
Under the tent they were encamped always ready
to march—in their houses they were fortified, ever
in a state of defence. Their breccia they struck out
into archways, or pierced with open works; but windows
were as little known to them as stirrups to
the Greeks or Romans. From this court, in the centre,
come the lights. I need not repeat what I have
already said respecting it, which the reader will find
in the account of a Jewish house at Arzela.</p>

<p>A Moorish house was made in the style of a
cavern or grotto, and its pendulous interior fret-work
strikes every one as something resembling the stalactites
of a cave (<ins title="petrêrephes, autoktit’ antra" lang="el">πετρήρεφες, αὐτοκτίτ’ ἄντρα</ins>). The
weight, therefore, of the roof, and the deficiency
of timber, conjoined to maintain that original structure
of long narrow rooms adjoining the court-yard,
which originated in the materials of their building
and the necessities of their defence, and which
were admirably adapted to their climate, and suited
to the habit which it engendered of living in community.</p>

<p>As the room of the Turks presents to us the Triclinium
of the Greeks, so do the houses of Morocco
the dwellings of the Hebrews, and furnish the explanation
of obscure passages in the Scriptures: to
the Moorish houses as exactly applies every term
having reference to houses or buildings, as those
having reference to clothing do to the Moorish dress.</p>

<p>The Hebrews originally dwelt in tents. When they
returned from Egypt they found the Holy Land filled
with fenced cities. They came from the wilderness
as the Arabs now do into Suez from the Sahara.
They adopted the settled manners of the people, but
tribes identified with them, such as the Kenites and
Rechabites, continued to live under tents. The domestic
architecture of the Jews was thus properly
Canaanitish, and is in Morocco what it was in the
Holy Land when the Jews entered.</p>

<p>The Arab under his tent, and the Breber in his
solid house of tapia, with its square towers, picture
to the life the period of Caleb and Joshua. This
architecture, transferred to Morocco nearly three thousand
years ago, has here continued to subsist, while
it has been extinguished—utterly blotted out in
Judæa. It required the protecting mounds of ruins to
preserve the fashions of the chambers of the Assyrian
kings, which have lived through all this course
of ages unharmed by the breath of heaven or the
hand of man, in Tetuan and Tangier.</p>

<p>Spain had not her tapia from the Saracens, as already
shown; she received it, and with it her architecture,
from the same sources as Morocco. We are informed
by St. Isidore that, in the fifth century, the Goths
had adopted the same mode of building—of course
from the Iberians, who are the source of most things
which we are so fond of calling Saracenic in Spain,
whether architecture, blood, manners, or words. Like
Judæa, Spain—though not to the same extent—had
lost her original type, and Morocco remained, at the
time of the Saracen conquest, the treasure-house of
the ancient world, and the museum of human history.</p>

<p>That Morocco did continue in the usufruct of this
inheritance, may be seen in the buildings they immediately
commenced in Spain, and in the accounts
handed down of the splendour of the buildings of
Morocco, in the first days of Islamism.</p>

<p>If this architecture of Judæa can be understood and
explained by the existing buildings in Morocco, does
the converse hold? Would the description of Moorish
architecture apply to the buildings of Judæa?
Do we, in fact, in looking upon the Alcazars and
Alhambras, behold the image of the Palace of Hiram
or the Temple of Solomon? That question I cannot
answer in the affirmative. There is nothing described
of the buildings of Judæa that is not to be found in
those of Morocco; but there is that in those of Morocco
which, had it existed in Judæa, could not have
failed to have been described. The descriptions of
the buildings in Spain, if they disappeared, would
not correspond with those of Judæa. The architecture
of Canaan has undergone a change in the West.</p>

<p>That which attracts attention to the Moresque and
awakens enthusiasm, is the tracery upon the walls,
the pensile figures of the arches, and the domes with
their colours. To these no reference is made in ancient
writers, and of them no trace has been preserved;
yet are they embellishments too striking not
to be observed, and too beautiful to have been lost
in such an age. Had there been an Alhambra at
Jerusalem or at Tyre, we should have found something
like it on the banks of the Nile, where the Jews
raised their rival temple; in the Baths of Lucullus
or in the Palaces of Antioch. Greek Virtuosi then
were spread over all these regions, and there were
the Ptolemies collecting all the stores of art and
literature, who garrisoned fortresses with the Jews,
and who were spurred on by envy of Tyre and rivalry
with Carthage.</p>

<p>We have, then, two points most distinctly made
out—first, that the substance of the walls, and the
structure of the edifices, the roofing, the wood-painting,
of Judæa, corresponded with those of Morocco.
Secondly, that the embellishments of vivid and varied
colours, and the delicate lace-work, known as Arabesque,
did not exist in Judæa.</p>

<p>The latter constitutes, to our eyes, the Moorish architecture,
but, from what I have said, it will appear
that it is but a garment over it. When, then, was
it added thereto? by whom was it invented? where
was it first applied? It is one of the greatest
efforts that has been ever made; it is enough to
make an epoch. We must look for it in some period
of greatness, of some seat of empire, under some
prince pre-eminent in all the attributes which can
command the admiration of men. We turn to Damascus—to
the Caliphat: we have no traces of it there,
and no relic. The earliest monuments eastward are
found at Alexandria, and then only in fragments;
and there is neither the thing nor the type. Did
it, then, spring up on the soil of Spain, in that
favoured region? No. We find it in the very earliest
monuments of the Moors. When they entered Spain,
it was already formed and complete.</p>

<p>It was, therefore, in Morocco, that the architecture
of Judæa underwent those changes, expanded into
those graceful forms, and robed itself in those rainbow
colours.</p>

<p>There are natural features and primitive habits
which suggest or account for each of these modifications—features
so striking that they could not fail to be
observed, and so beautiful that they must have been
copied: these I have described as they presented
themselves to me. The types which I found in nature
or in practice are of the stalactitic, dome, and
arch,—the horseshoe arch, the tracery on the wall,
the diversified colouring of that tracery, the half-globe
dome upon the cube; and these, in fact, are
the modifications that the architecture of Judæa received,
and by which it has been converted into the
Moorish.</p>

<p>On the material the system of architecture depended,
and it is wholly different from the classic.
The great styles of antiquity depended, not on the
adhesion of the stones, but their form and weight,
and by science alone they obtained arches. Thus
the perpendicular key-stone of the Egyptians, Etruscans,
and Romans, the horizontal and narrowing circle
of the Pelasgi, the massive rocks carved and transported
by the Egyptians, the inclining jamb of the
Cyclops (Tyrius and Lamos), the column and entablature
of the Greek, all depended on mechanical
science, and, therefore, the form of the passage through
a wall, became a distinctive feature of a race. The
tapia, by its adhesion, constituted as it were a rock
in the form of a dwelling; they required no mechanical
adjustments to obtain the openings,—they could
make them at pleasure; square, or with a semicircular
or pointed arch or a horse-shoe. They dug
through the walls; so, in like manner, could they carry
them to any height, and build them for any number
of ages. Hence, the square, massive solidity of the
Moorish structure; hence, the absence of all exterior
lines of architecture for embellishments; hence, the
ornaments of the material itself; hence, the bold facility
and the endless variety which they gave to
their arches; hence, the rich decorations and lightness
of the interior contrasted with the exterior rudeness
and gravity; hence, the adornment of that interior
by tesselated pavements and variegated walls.</p>

<p>Here was architecture in its essence: the covering-in
of the top, the erecting of the wall, was the work
of barrow-men. The carpenter, the craftsman was
required for laying on the beams, and making the
terrace water-tight. Within, the roof is as important
as without; for as it is upon the roof that depends
the durability, and I may say, solidity of the structure,
so in the roof consists the chief embellishment
of the apartment.</p>

<p>Nothing is weak—nothing frittered away. Simple,
but never rude; unadorned, but never base; severe,
and yet in the highest degree attractive; the Æschylean
Majesty of the Doric order is the very highest
conception that even Grecian art could realize. The
contemplation, even in the meanest engraving, of one
of its matchless porticos, in all the stern grace of the
column, capital, and cornice, is absolutely overwhelming.
And this climax of pure dignity, this expression
of heathendom in its noblest form, this embodied
<ins title="kalon" lang="el">καλὸν</ins>, such as the Hellenic mind only could compass,
we are gravely told was borrowed from the hideous
and unmeaning monstrosities of the race who
paid divine honours to the lowest vermin, and whom
their gardens supplied with appropriate objects of
veneration!<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_369"></a><a href="#footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a></span></p>

<p>Coleridge, by transferring into our language something
of the verbal chemistry of Kant, prompted combinations
of terms as if they had been compounds
of simple elements; he did not give new substances,
but conferred the facility of travelling out of reality.
Wordsworth, using the objects of art and nature as
suggesting devotional thoughts, diverted the mythology
of the Greeks to the service of the faith, and
thought it a conquest. Thus by peopling the forest,
the cave, the vault, and the spire with mystic beings,
and supplying them with hidden meanings, he contributed
his part to theirs.</p>

<h4 class="h4head"><span class="allsmcap">GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE FROM SPAIN.</span></h4>

<p class="p2">That the grandest of styles should be known by
the name of the rudest of people—that architecture
should be called after dwellers in tents and tenants
of huts—that the Goths should have ceased to exist
before the Gothic was invented is, indeed, a phenomenon.
The word, nevertheless, has served during
many centuries all the purposes of a name, and does
not appear until these latter days to have been the object
of criticism or cavil. At last the word “Gothic”
became a field of literary debate, and immediately
of religious discussion. Some articles in a magazine,
on the architecture of the Middle Ages, connecting
incidentally therewith contemporary practices and dogmas,
was the first symptom of the hallucination, out
of which arose two schools of mystagogues, theologians
materializing dogmas, and mathematicians
idealizing forms. In these transmutations the gross
did not become ethereal, nor the airy, grave; but the
solid melted into air, and the spirit was turned to
mud. Under this double perversion of piety and
science we had the progressive developements for the
structure of conscience, and an
arch.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_370"></a><a href="#footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a></span> Gothic art
and Christian faith were deduced from Paganism by
a “series of conversations”—suppositions regarding
the centre of a vault, were called “tenets,”—the
change of an ornament was a “manifestation”—finally
a cathedral was a “petrifaction of religion”—<em>Art</em>
was called “<em>Christian</em>,” and then, of course, the Reformation
could be re-argued upon the plan of an
architect.</p>

<p>It was truly a Pagan thought to call art-religions
the appropriation of art; it was the very life of
Paganism, and justly did Quintilian say, that the
Minerva and Jupiter of Phidias “added something
to religion.”</p>

<p>But these things were for those without the veil.
The initiated were untaught art and its symbolism,
and to them was revealed the immaterial existence
of the Godhead, his solitary being, and omnipotent
power. “That which was at first a gross symbol,”
says De Quincy, “became a sublime metaphor, because
invested with the poetry of art.” With us the external
expressions of the feelings of a devout age
have been changed by the pedantry of a learned one
into objects of idolatry; and Christians direct Christians
back to the mysteries of Pagans unteaching
the truth which Pagans knew, and pretend to reform
their own worship by transferring to the sanctuary
the external images in which the Pagans presented
natural religion only to the uninstructed crowd.</p>

<p>In the religions of the ancient world, Fetichism
lay at the bottom: the gods of the country were
raised into deities, or these were brought down as
patrons of the spot. It was an honour and a security
to address them; there was no idea of proselyting
the arts; the wealth of the votary or the stranger
was expended on their service. Christianity presented
a new character, the reverse of all that preceded it;
men were to be saved from craft and its devices,
from art and its enchantments, from vice and its
seductions, from the world and its wisdom. It was
a religion of proselytism, repentance, and abnegation.
It was preached by fishermen and addressed to babes.
It thus stood the very antithesis of Polytheism, and
the association of art and religion was as essentially
an un-Christian, as it was essentially a Pagan thought.</p>

<p>Architecture has given rise to these aberrations
only because its history is unknown. The architecture
of Europe, as revived subsequently to the eighth
century, was from the Saracens: they communicated
to Europe the impulse which retrieved her from that
lethargy, or, as M. Guizot calls it, that death by the
extinction of every function which came upon her
after she had made experience of Rome and her
greatness—Christianity and her light—the Barbarians
and their vigour. They furnished also the models
and the first workmen. Had it been known that
ecclesiastical architecture came from a Mussulman
source, surely we should not have heard of “the Gothic
springing from the Bible,” and like foolish speeches.</p>

<p>Of kinds of excellence, or periods of greatness,
architecture has furnished the fewest. How many
are the admirable languages, systems of government,
and epochs of splendour! The whole human race,
during thousands of years, have brought forth scarcely
more than two or three distinct styles of architecture.
Language is learnt unconsciously; it survives
under every vicissitude. A political system a
founder may plan. In science, by the discovery of
one, all benefit,—painting or sculpture arises when
a few excel. Architecture belongs to the circumstances,
no less than the genius of a people, the
climate under which they live, the soil on which they
dwell, their customs, and their belief. The knowledge
or taste from which it springs must be universal, so
also the habits it engenders.</p>

<p>Buildings are raised for man’s necessities, by his
labour: they are the creatures of his hand; they are
the most permanent, the most essential of the types
of his race; they have embraced and protected the
lowliness and weakness of his origin; they have expanded
with his growth, hardened themselves in his
danger, swelled into magnificence in his pride, or
arisen to sublimity in his adoration. Architecture has
laboured itself into life by long trial and patient progress.
Like no other art, it is within the grasp of no
individual genius: the materials are of the rudest
kind, the labour is conducted in the people’s eye, the
poor man is the workman, and the embellishments are
of the commonest nature. Architecture is as identified
with the people, as the nest with the bird, or the
honeycomb with the bee.</p>

<p>How, then, should architecture have come into being
in the midst of an unlettered race, without a previous
traceable conception and gestation; and how should
it at once be applied on the grandest scale to the
noblest monuments, without previous practice and
adaptation in private uses to common life? Yet
this must have been the case, had an original architecture
arisen among the inhabitants of the North,
whether Saxons or Normans. Nor is it a science
standing by itself; it is the application of many other
sciences previously pursued and thoroughly understood.
Mathematics and dynamics must prepare the
way, by calculation of the pressure of weights and
the power of supports; and above all is such preparation
requisite in that style which combines height,
solidity, lightness, and symmetry, depending upon the
proportioning of shafts, the inclination of buttresses,
the curve of arches, and the groining of vaults. How
should perfection in all these have been attained,
by tribes emerging from their forests, or landing from
their hide-covered boats? To-day, amidst the wonderful
progress of all other sciences—with models
before us—with the greatest zeal and opportunities—seeing
the enormities which result from every architectural
plan—shall we suppose that it should have
sprung at once to perfection among a people inexpert
in other arts and ignorant of every science?</p>

<p>There were, indeed, before the tribes that overthrew
the Roman empire, the models of classical
antiquity; but they, when they began to build, built
in another style. It is very easy in the varieties of
times and places, to trace here and there coincidences
and adaptations, which theorists, by the aid of analogies
and similes, may connect. It is easy to draw
scales of lines and forms, which shall show an insensible
progression from the Erechtheum to Westminster
Hall; but the style that then arose was as distinct
from the Greek and Roman, as these from the Egyptian,
the Chinese, or the Hindoo. But had they
restored the classical, would the mere existence of
the models explain the fact? They had Cicero and
Homer, without being orators or poets, and, though
England was filled with Roman masonry, the making
of bricks was a new discovery a thousand years after
their departure. The sight of masterpieces does not
suffice, even for copying them—that is a new invention.
Man requires living teachers, and these were
no more to be found in the organic remains of classical
architecture than in their own unfashioned
thoughts and uncultivated faculties.</p>

<p>Independently of these <i lang="fr">à priori</i> reasons, we find
this architecture not springing up at any definite
moment, or at any particular spot, but arising simultaneously
amidst a variety of tribes, such as would
occur if derived from a foreign and a common source.
Where, then, are we to look for that source, if not
amidst the almost fabulous people, which at that
very time appeared in the South?</p>

<p>It is no novel idea that Northern architecture was
derived from the Saracens; but our supposed intercourse
with that people is confined to the Crusades,
which, coinciding, indeed, with, or shortly preceding,
the Gothic style, followed by centuries the Saxon and
the Norman; and as the three are so intimately associated
that they do in reality constitute but one style
of architecture, the admitted obligation is reduced,
so to say, to nothing, by the great effort of the first
invention being attributed to ourselves: or rather
we lose sight of the greatness of the effort by supposing
it to have been made where faculties equal
to it had no existence, and we fall into this necessity
by not seeing how, if not of our own invention, we
could have borrowed the first
steps.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_371"></a><a href="#footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a></span></p>

<p>But the intercourse of Northern Europe with the
Saracens preceded the Crusades by four or five centuries,
and the intercourse of England with Africa
preceded Islamism. The first architectural movement
in England, in the age of St. Winifred, followed
by half a century the erection of the mosque of
Omar at Jerusalem, one of the noblest monuments
in the world. The Lombard style arose in the south
of Italy after these people had come in contact with
the Saracens, and learnt their arts, and employed
their artists. The second architectural age in England
was that of the Normans: it was preceded by
their conquests in Calabria and Sicily, inhabited by
the Saracens, who excelled—as the ruins left behind
them attest—in the very highest branches of this
art. The Gothic arose in Europe, when the Goths
of Spain were regaining power in the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries, and they could emulate the arts
and command the services of their Moorish competitors;
and the Spanish peculiarities of the style
passed into Europe with their name, precisely in the
same manner as that of the Norman or the Lombard
before them.</p>

<p>The most common and primitive style of Moorish
arching is the flat wall cut into the semicircle, supported
without entablature on wall or column. That
is exactly the Saxon: it was only known to them
after they had crossed the seas: they did not find
it in England—they must have acquired it in the
course of their maritime enterprises; and they were
familiar with Western Africa, then inhabited by
Christians. Hadrian, the counsellor of Alfred, who
first brought Greek letters to England, was from
Africa. African Christians, as recorded in old Spanish
charters, built churches in the north of Spain,
where the Mussulmans never penetrated. By Domesday
Book we find Africans settled in England at the
time of the Conquest. Constantinus Afer was founder
of the school of Salerno; and the old British
bards mention African princes as the allies of their
Saxon invaders.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_372"></a><a href="#footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a></span>
The Saxon race came in contact
with the Saracens in the earliest times of Islam by
pilgrimages to the Holy Land—they served in the
armies of the Greek emperors. From the time of
Constantine, an uninterrupted connexion of the Arabs
and Northmen, during four centuries, is attested by
twenty thousand Saracenic coins in the Cabinet of
Stockholm, found in Gothland and along the eastern
coast of Sweden.</p>

<p>Having thus established the improbability of an
original architecture among our Northern forefathers;
having shown in the previous chapter the existence
in western Barbary of the style which had descended
from the earliest antiquity, and having now indicated
the channels through which it might have
passed thence to Europe, and the links between
Africa and each of the races who were distinguished
for any of its varieties, I shall now proceed to the
internal evidence the buildings themselves afford.</p>

<p>The present buildings of Africa are doubtless
exactly what they were in the time of Mahomet,
and before the conquests of the Saracens. They
contain the rudiments of the Gothic, Saxon, and Roman
styles. The tomb is a cube, surmounted by a
half-globe vault. The door-way is an arch, horseshoe
form, semicircular or pointed; it is shouldered
by a spandrel. Exactly the same are the tombs of
India—the great monuments of Jehangir and Akbar,
which by some, from a mistake in the date, have
been considered as the type and the model of the
Gothic.</p>

<p>The building next in importance is the tower,
which is composed of these cubes placed one above
the other: the inner tower rises at the top higher
than the outer one. In their domestic architecture
they use flat roofs; but in the mosques they employ
rows of gable roofs, supported below by columns and
arches. There are sometimes double rows of arches,
and intersecting arches. Their dwelling-houses are
enriched with a great variety of details, which may
be compared to miniature representations of the embellishments
of our religious edifices, such as niches,
small pointed windows, pierced spandrels, mouldings,
and cornices. The same style pervades every kind
of building, ornament, and utensil,—their tombstones,
their cushions, the wood-work of their apartments,
their trays, their stools, the latter of which might be
taken for small models of Gothic buildings.</p>

<p>It was impossible to behold daily these objects,
and not perceive that Morocco, whence issued the
people who raised the great monuments in
Spain,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_373"></a><a href="#footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a></span>
had been the native country of the Gothic. The
long vault and taper spire, indeed, were wanting;
nor were there any buildings to which, as a whole,
the title of Saxon, Norman, or Gothic could be applied.
But then it occurred to me, that these modifications
might be traceable through the Saracens,
and in their various settlements in Europe, down to
the historical period of the art in its European sites.
To pursue such an investigation appropriately would
require a lifetime. However, I have examined buildings
in sufficient numbers to trace, and I think establish,
the connection.</p>

<p>The Saracens were established, not in Spain only,
but also in the important island of Sicily, and the
southern extremity of Italy. These were conquered at
an early period by the Normans, and the Saracens continued
for half a century under them, working for
them, building chapels, churches, palaces, and
cathedrals.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_374"></a><a href="#footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a></span>
These Normans were in continual intercourse
with their native country on the British channel.
Passing constantly through France, they soon afterwards
conquered England. It was this people who gave
the great impulse to architecture in the eleventh century
in England and France; and thus arose the style
known by their name; not merely raising those buildings
by the wealth they possessed in Normandy, or
acquired in England, but even by contributions made
from the booty of Calabria, and the spoils of Sicily.
It is a remarkable fact, that a connexion so well authenticated
between the Normans and the Saracens,
should be passed by unnoticed by the writers upon
architecture. For my own part, when I stood within
the north transept of the Cathedral of Winchester,
where the Norman portion has remained undisturbed,
I should have been sure of that connexion, had no
records of it been preserved.</p>

<p>Theophilus cites the Arabs (of course of Sicily) as
excelling in a branch wherein we have least acknowledged
their merit—the working of metals: he particularizes
its various branches, casting, hammering,
and chiseling.</p>

<p>“The Arabs,” says Vasari, “have given their name
to a species of ornament, which they have invented
in obedience to the precepts of their Prophet, and
which is composed only of fruits and flower foliage,
and embranchments.” May not this description, so
unlike the Arabesque as we know it in the Peninsula,
be derived from the chased works of the Arabs
in Sicily, where, out of their alliance with the Greeks,
a character sprang very distinct from that to which
their union with the Moors gave birth in the
West?</p>

<p>The oldest of the specimens we have in Sicily, is the
Capella Palatine, built, soon after the conquest of the
island, by Roger. It approaches to that square form
adopted by the Eastern churches, to which Sicily then
belonged, after there had ceased to be catechumens,
and so consisted of the solea and meroi, to the exclusion
of the elongated <dfn>naos</dfn> or nave.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_375"></a><a href="#footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a></span>
The chapel is
small, but it is one of the most perfect—if not the
most perfect—pieces of workmanship in the world.
The floor, roof, and walls, are completely inlaid, or
incrusted, with marble or mosaic. There is a wide
band running round the apse in Arabic characters.
This led to its being supposed to be a mosque. The
inscription, however, is a long string of honorary
epithets applied to
Roger.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_376"></a><a href="#footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a></span></p>

<p>From the succeeding reign we have the Cathedral
of Cefala, the Church Dell, Amigralio, that of Jerusalem,
the Royal Chapel of St. Peter’s, and the splendid
Hall of William I., all in like manner the work
of the Saracens. There is no single instance among
them of a horse-shoe arch. There is no vaulting of
the roof; but in the Cathedral of Cefala there is a
perfect Norman arch, bevelled or chamfered, and exactly
the same as we see them in the north of Europe.
This edifice bears a Latin inscription attributing to
a Saracen the honour of the construction, “<i lang="la">Hoc
opus musei factum est</i>;” but these buildings were
greatly surpassed by the Cathedral of Montreale,
erected by William <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> It is adorned with arches,
traced upon the walls without, and they are all
Gothic; the floor of the Solea is laid down in marble
in Arabesque figures; the walls are encrusted with
marbles or mosaics, or covered with paintings; the
gates are in bronze chased; the doors and windows—many
of them, at least—are in the old classic style
of Greece; the outline of the building is also classical
and rectangular, but ornamented with intersecting
Gothic arches, which spring from the jamb
unbroken by cornice, capital, or entablature. On the
whole it presents in dimensions, height, richness of
material, elegance of design, variety and adaptation
of styles, an object of art unique. It is singular
that this greatest work of the Normans in the South
should have in it no trace either of that style which
we call Norman,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_377"></a><a href="#footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a></span>
or of that which is the peculiar
feature of the Moor, the horse-shoe; and the two
styles that are there united, and which nowhere else
are so found, are the Greek and the Gothic. At the
time of its erection this cathedral was esteemed the
masterpiece of architecture, and as surpassing at once
St. Sophia, and the St. Peter’s, of that day. Pope
Lucius says of it: “<i lang="la">Simile opus per aliquem regem
factum non fuerit ab antiquis temporibus.</i>” The
Duke di Sara de Falco, who published at Palermo,
in 1838, elaborate and beautiful engravings of it, has
collated with some of its ornaments, fragments from
Owen Jones’s “Alhambra;” but it is as Moorish as
the Alhambra itself. The towers are divided into
stories, and each is somewhat smaller than the one
beneath, so that they have the appearance of buttresses
without being really so. The Sicilian author
and artist says:—</p>

<p>“While this temple was building there arose in
Palermo the magnificent Duomo, and the Church of
the Holy Ghost in Messina, the Cathedral and the
Church of St. Mary, at Raudazzo, and so many others
that it is needless to cite. We have ascertained that
the artists employed at Montreale were neither Italian
nor Greek, but Sicilians; and that is rendered more
manifest by the Mosaic work, and the details of
ornament and construction so largely drawn from
the Arabs, which certainly did not come from the
Greeks of the East, but from those who, long familiarized
with the Saracens, had imitated their manner;
and that a school of these workers in mosaics existed
in Sicily is demonstrated by the variety of composition,
the fertility of genius, and the power of design
in those days, and they all agree with the workmanship
of Montreale.”</p>

<p>He then proceeds to claim for his country the honour
of introducing chasings and carvings into Italy,
and Gothic architecture into Europe: the former he
deduces from the ancient Greek arts of Sicily, the
second from the Saracens.</p>

<p>In Spain the Goths were as entirely the pupils and
followers of the Saracens as were the Normans in
Sicily. The variation of style from the Moresque to
the Spanish, or Gothic, was connected with the difference
of the social habits of the people. The Moors
in Spain remained constituted by tribe,—as much so
as in the Desert, although without its space. The
feuds of the different tribes of Yemen were transferred
to Cordova and Seville; and a fray between
two uleds bordering on the Great Desert might suddenly
produce bloodshed in the narrow lanes and
thick villages of Andalusia. There were also the frequent
ruptures and the permanent animosity between
Brebers and Arabs, and thus their buildings of necessity
retained externally the ponderous and castellated
form, while their perfection in the various arts
of decoration embellished them internally with stuccoes,
carvings, gildings, paintings, enamel and mosaics.
The Spaniards, as they recovered the country,
were on the one hand, relieved from these sources
of continual alarm; and, on the other, were destitute
of those arts of interior decoration: hence a
more aspiring exterior, and a more gloomy interior;
and upon the stones was concentrated the care which
the Arabs had to give to so many other materials.</p>

<p>There has been a great destruction in Spain of
Moorish buildings. We do possess, indeed, but two
remarkable ones; the one the fragment of a palace
raised within latter days, the other a mosque, the
first in fame, but also the first in date, being now
1300 years old. It does not, therefore, afford us
the opportunity of judging of the progress of the
art. There subsist, however, some smaller specimens
of a later date, which might almost be taken for Gothic
buildings.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_378"></a><a href="#footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a></span></p>

<p>The characteristics of the Gothic are—the pointed
arch; the arch resting on the column without entablature;
vaulting; arched gateways; splayed windows;
buttresses; the spire tower, or belfry. These may
severally be traced to the Saracens.

<p class="p2 center allsmcap">THE POINTED ARCH.</p>

<p>This is to be found from the first moment of the
appearance of the Arabs, in countries the most remote
from each other, and in structures destined to the
most diverse purposes. I may instance:—</p>

<p>The Mosque of Omar at Jerusalem, the first building
of the Saracens, commenced <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>
637.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_379"></a><a href="#footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a></span></p>

<p>The Mosque of Amrou, at Cairo, the first Mussulman
building in Africa, commenced towards <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 650.
That of E’Naser Mohammed, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>
698.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_380"></a><a href="#footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a></span> The Nilometer
(lancet-niches), <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 700. Shella, in Morocco,
date uncertain, probably anterior to the Mussulman
era.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_381"></a><a href="#footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a></span>
The Tower of Alcamo, in Sicily, the earliest
Mussulman building in Eastern
Europe.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_382"></a><a href="#footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a></span> The Tower
of Gibraltar, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 745, which contains a regular Gothic
church window, though now built up. The Cathedral
of Montreale, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1174, where the arch springs unbroken
from the jamb. In fact, whenever the Saracens
appeared, they brought the arch we call Gothic.
It is found in universal use by them, and was so used
by no people before them. When used by any people,
the connexion with them may be traced. In Morocco
or Spain may be found all known arches—the
elliptical, the four-centred, the horizontal, the surbased,
the lancet, the angular—if I may so describe
one unknown to us, and formed like a truncated
triangle. They had the stilt arch, the ogee, and, at
Seville, is to be found a specimen of our recent invention,
the skew arch; they had the trefoil, the
pentifoil, as ornaments, with a multitude of unclassed
and unnamed forms, which may, in our terms, be characterized
as pensile, stalagmitic, serrated, cusped, fanned,
dentiled. These may be studied in Jones’s
Alhambra.</p>

<p class="p2 center allsmcap">CHAMFERING OF THE ARCH.</p>

<p>I am not aware that this modification exists on the
soil of Africa to-day, unless in a fragment described
in the Pentapolis, by Dr. Shaw: this is the modification
of the Norman upon the Saxon, and is to be
found in the Cathedral of Cefala, and the tower of
Gibraltar.</p>

<p class="p2 center allsmcap">VAULTING.</p>

<p>This portion of modern architecture is Roman; but
it in no way suffices to say that the Roman had vaults
to account for our having them: the models of a
dead people do not introduce a new art; the Saracens
did not copy the classical models. The Moors
had, indeed, the half-sphere, as the Romans; but they
had not the elongated vault. The pointed and elongated
vault, with its intersections, was, therefore, original
in the Gothic, and may have been constructed
by the Saracens, in Spain. To it there was the
closest approximation in their pointed arches, doorways,
and windows. The gable form of their mosque
roofs would suggest the pointed and not the semicircular
vault. Whenever they covered these in stone,
here was the point—where their original material, the
tapia, failed, it could rise from four sides into a
dome; but elongated vaulting, and its intersections
and groinings, depended upon the mechanical adjustment
of the separate stones. When they came to
build in this fashion in Spain (as in Egypt, Syria,
Sicily, &amp;c.), their mathematical skill would be called
into play, and they must, of necessity, have thrown
stone roofs over the large churches and cathedrals
which they were employed by the Christians to
build.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_383"></a><a href="#footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2 center allsmcap">ARCHED GATEWAYS.</p>

<p>This is one of the most remarkable features of the
Gothic, so unlike the doors of any other style, giving
such grandeur to the edifices, and suggesting,
even at once, its whole designs. And here the identification
is complete—the entrance to every Moorish
room is like the porch of a cathedral, and the massive
portals that close them with the wicket, presents
in every Moorish court the gateway of a monastery
or a <dfn>college</dfn>.</p>

<p class="p2 center allsmcap">WINDOWS AND STAINED GLASS.</p>

<p>From the want of windows in Moorish houses and
mosques, and from the great dimensions, elaborate
structure, and important office of windows in our
churches and cathedrals, it might be supposed that
here we should be at fault in tracing the connexion;
but the Moors afford us the most interesting rudiments
of the stone-framed figures of our window, and
the painted glass with which they are embellished.</p>

<p>Above and beside the door in Moorish rooms, there
are small apertures for air rather than light, generally
narrow, with a trefoil head. Two, four, or more of
these may be placed side by side, and over them a
circular figure pierced in like manner. In some of the
Spanish cathedrals—and I again quote Toledo—there
are windows which represent these openings in the
wall, and <em>are glazed</em>. In the Alhambra, the Alcazar of
Seville, and every other Moorish structure in Spain,
there are to be seen the pierced work in stucco, in
the form of Gothic windows;—the patterns of these
correspond with the tracery on the walls, which
being in colour, it was natural to continue the
patterns in colour to the open spaces; and to effect
this, where the exposure required it, bits of painted
glass are stuck into the plaster while fresh. A
colder climate would suggest the extension of the
glass, the reduction of the stucco, and the substitution
of stone for stucco. Glass for windows was
peculiarly a Spanish art; it was already known in
England and France in the seventh
century:<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_384"></a><a href="#footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a></span> the
staining of glass commenced in Spain, though it was
carried to the highest perfection in France. Two of
the colours and substances were designated Spanish at a
time when few original colouring matters were
employed.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_385"></a><a href="#footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a></span>
The Saracens were, besides, proficients in
the making of glass, whether transparent or coloured.
The first I accidentally fell upon in the Mosque at Cordova—they
used coloured glass for the mosaics; but
it was opaque;—they also understood enamelling, and
in encaustic tiles they were unrivalled. Stained glass
is, to this day, of universal use among the Easterns,
who have spread more to the northward, and have
adopted external windows. A Turkish room is a miniature
cathedral, with its ascending floor; its entrance
opposite to its lights, and its clerestory windows,—for
there are two rows of them—the lower one rectangular
like ours, and furnished with curtains, the upper
one of every variety of shape, and in stained glass,
and made to correspond with the ornaments of the
corresponding panels of the apartment.</p>

<p>The apertures in the Moorish tapia thus became
Gothic windows, and the pierced patterns of the stucco
mullions and transoms, with cusped trefoils and
foliage in stone, with the intervals glazed in stained
glass: the adjoining portion of the wall must then
have been pared away and bevelled out. The Moors
were the first people to adopt this process, as applying
it to military architecture: they adopted it for
their loopholes and embrasures, while bows and
arrows were yet in use. Their first external windows
were embrasures—churches were built for defence as
well as devotion. The bevelling in their walls is on
both sides less without than within, exactly as it
is practised in Gothic windows.

<p class="p2 center allsmcap">BUTTRESSES.</p>

<p>Next to the arch itself the buttress has been considered
essential to the Gothic.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_386"></a><a href="#footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a></span>
This member is
supposed to have its origin in the North, and to have
been requisite for the passage from the Norman to
the Gothic, and from the tower to the spire. The
buttress is to be found among the Arabs, as early as
the pointed arch, and as universally known, though
not so commonly used.</p>

<p>The square building at Gibraltar, used as a magazine,
and with a sort of pyramidal roof, is strengthened
by powerful and expanding buttresses, irregularly
placed on the angles, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 749. Specimens are abundant
at Jerusalem, in Cairo, and in Sicily.</p>

<p>I have met with no instance of flying buttresses:
these, however, may be seen in Spain, carried to a
width unknown elsewhere;—as for instance, in the
Cathedral of Seville.</p>

<p class="p2 center allsmcap">THE TOWER AND SPIRE.</p>

<p>The early English towers are copies of those of
Morocco. The Moorish tower stands apart from the
Mosque: so do our early belfries and the Campanile
of Italy. The spire has been naturally suggested by
the minaret, which may be connected with the obelisk,
being the only instance of the kind in the ancient
world; and the minaret having been first adapted to
Saracenic buildings in Egypt, where it was engrafted
on the <dfn>Sma</dfn> or square tower of the Moors—together
they constitute our spire, as seen in the half tower,
half minaret of Egypt.</p>

<p>If any one will turn over successively the pages
of Roberts’s Holy Land, Costes’ Egypt, Hope’s German
Churches, Sara de Fulco’s Sicily, and Gally Knight’s
Italy, he will recognise the features of the one in
the other, and trace the resemblances just as if turning
over the grammars of various languages derived
from a common source.</p>

<p class="p2 center allsmcap">CLOISTERS.</p>

<p>The quadrangle with the columns sustaining the
advanced building of the first story, over an open
corridor below, is as Moorish as if the models had
been sent from
Morocco.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_387"></a><a href="#footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a></span>
The court of the Monastery
of Bellem at Lisbon, is the most beautiful
specimen I know. It is at once purely Gothic and
purely Moorish; each style seeming to have taken
something from the other to heighten its effect. In
the centre is a fountain, and on each side lines of
tanks for water, intersected with stages for plants,
which are lined with coloured tiles around: there
are Gothic arches, filled with the screen or stonework
of windows—without the glass, as in the Campo
Sancto of Pisa. In the angles of the quadrangle, the
limbs of a projecting and wider arch seem to embrace
and protect a sharper arch within. This may be
seen in Moorish works, and also in the porch of the
Cathedral of Rouen. The church belonging to this
monastery presents an interesting field for studying
the influence of the Moors upon European architecture,
and it is in every way a building not less
original than beautiful.</p>

<p>A connexion between Africa and England is traceable
in a point where we might least expect it, and
at a very early period—and that is fire-places. “Chimneys,”
says Mr. Hallam, “which had been missed by
the sagacity of Greece and Rome—a discovery of
which Vitruvius never dreamed—was made perhaps
in this country by some forgotten
barbarian.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_388"></a><a href="#footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a></span> He
refers to Coningsby Castle, supposed to be of a date
prior to the Conquest, to prove the existence of chimneys,
before the alleged date of the discovery in the
fourteenth century. Had he inspected the chimney
in question, he must have perceived a peculiar and
unique method of joining the key-stones of the flat
arch that supports the front in lieu of a mantelpiece.
This process, unique in Europe, is common amongst
the Moors.</p>

<p>Whoever has visited the East must have been struck
with the original character of the fireplaces and
chimney-pieces; they are an embellishment to the
room, in what we should term the Decorated Gothic
style. Whoever has looked down upon the city of Lisbon
from its garden-fortress, cannot fail to observe the
contrast between the small neat rows of apertures
that serve for chimney tops, and our unsightly and
grotesque expedients for the same purpose. Whether
in the mode of placing the fire, in the embellishment
of the portion of the room appropriated to it, or in
the elegance of chimney tops (so as to change them
from a blemish to an ornament), we have yet to learn
and borrow from the Moors. These chimney tops
and appliances are not to be seen indeed in Morocco;
but the traces subsist further north, where they
adapted themselves to the necessities of the climate.
The general resemblance of feature is also to be traced
in the names, many of which I have already mentioned,
such as, house-door, barbican, dairy; but and
ben, and cabail of the Highlanders; roof, stable,
gypsum-house, garret, and even burgh, which we have
been content to take from the Greek <ins title="pyros" lang="el">πύρος</ins>, is after
all an Arabic word, in common use for pigeon-house,
when built in the form of a
tower.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_389"></a><a href="#footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a></span> In conjunction
with these we must take so many terms and usages,
exhibiting an intimate connexion between Africa and
England, dating from the decline of Roman power.</p>

<p>In these observations I neither propound a new
theory nor agitate a settled question. I present the
good and valid reasons upon which our ancestors
adopted a title, which we use with disgust and are
endeavouring to discard. I trace our architecture
back to the people to whom it properly pertains, and
through them to an antiquity venerable in itself and
deeply interesting from its association with the inspired
writings. But it is more particularly the
means of its introduction into Europe that it is useful
to establish; for this, if anything, might diminish
the <i lang="la">odium theologicum</i> which has sprung from this
source. A more perfect antidote there cannot be
than that this “Christian” art, this weapon of proselytism,
by which no religious community achieves
conquests, but by which all faith is smitten, should
be itself Mussulman, and that we should owe the
architecture (if there were any ratio between the
supposed cause and the effect) which we attribute
to the Bible, to the Koran.</p>

<p>What would have been the reply of the early
Christians, had such a mania then prevailed, to those
who argued the truth of polytheism, from the temples
that had been raised in its honour, or the statues with
which they were
adorned?<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_390"></a><a href="#footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a></span>
What, again, would
those have said, whose works are now taken as models,
had they been told that in a future age of light and
freedom their walls and arches should become steps
in the ladder of conviction, shibboleths in polemics
and lists of orthodoxy!<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a></span>
In the long and vehement
contests between the Christians and the Mussulmans
in Spain, both reciprocally used the temples of the
other, which were sometimes even divided between
them.</p>

<p>“Men have before now been led to adopt Romanism
by its fancied connexion with poetry, or painting, or
Gothic architecture; and if such men had lived while
the mythologies of Greece or of Rome were living
systems, they would with equal reason have forsaken
Christianity for heathen religions, in which art had
arrived at its highest conceivable excellence. The
adoption of religious views, merely because they are
in some way connected with what is gratifying to
our senses or our feelings, and without primary reference
to the evidence for their truth, is a proceeding
which seems indicative of a practical disbelief in the
evidence of any revealed truth, or of any religious
truth whatever.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_391"></a><a href="#footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a></span></p>

<p>The inhabitants of England, who first introduced
it in the North, did not call themselves Goths, but
Saxons: nor were the followers of William, Goths,
but Normans. The Gothic name had disappeared
from Europe as the designation of any country, and
the later modification of the style appeared, and the
epithet was applied. But there was one country in
which the name of the Goth was still preserved, and
that was Spain. That name would have disappeared
in Spain as elsewhere, had it not been for the Saracen
conquest. The Goths had not originally appeared
in Spain as ravagers or conquerors; they <em>came</em> in the
name and with the authority of the Roman empire
to drive out the Vandals, to put an end to anarchy,
to protect property, and to sustain the laws. The
people of Spain had evidently been disinclined to
espouse the quarrel of the Goths against the Saracens;
but, in subsequent attempts to throw off the Saracen
yoke, the Goths must have been their leaders; and in
fact to be a Goth was to be a freeman, and no longer
tributary to the Mussulmans. As the Christians reacquired
strength, they could neither take the title
of Andalusians, nor of Murcians, nor of Castilians,
far less of Spaniards, for these names belonged as
much to the Mussulmans as to themselves. They
took, therefore, that of Goths, an ancient and a noble
name, and associated at once with their national independence,
the traditions of Rome, and the authority
of the Christian Church; and to this day the peasant
of Spain, when he points out a great monument, will
say, “<i lang="es">Obra de los Godos</i>.” Gothic is to them synonymous
with heroic—the Gothic times, the Gothic
kings, Gothic courts, Gothic laws, Gothic glory. It
marks in Spanish history the period of struggling
and triumphant freedom. It is the period which contrasts
in all things with that known as “Catholic.”</p>

 “Has the attention of architects, or of writers on architecture,
been directed sufficiently to Spain? A comparison of the
genuine Saracenic remains in the Peninsula, with the earliest specimens
of Spanish architecture, in their details might do more to
illustrate the connexion of the two schools, and the history of
the pointed style, than has been effected, or is likely to be effected
by elaborate theories on the subject.”—<span class="smcap">Foster’s</span> <cite>Mahometanism

 I cannot help referring to that new absurd term Naology,
so perfectly pagan that it was even excluded by the Greeks, in
adapting their own terms to the Christian worship (see Simeon
of Thessalonica), (Leon, Allazzi, De Solea Goar, Rituale Græc.).
Whewell is at the same time endeavouring to exclude the term
“nave,” where we have got the thing, substituting for it, “<em>centre</em>
aisle.”</p>

 Ugon Falcandus, in Carusi Bib. Sicul., b. i. <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 487. This
inscription corresponds with that upon the Dalmatic, which was
supposed to have been the imperial robe of Charlemagne. Tyschen
has, however, made it out to be the work of the Arabs of
Palermo, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1132. A baptismal font at Caltabellota bears an
Arabic inscription, which is interpreted by M. Lanci—“Office

 In the Norman buildings the pointed arch occurs. Mr. Whewell,
observing the fact, instead of concluding that the various
styles were contemporaneous, gets rid of the fact, as usual, by
a theoretical explanation.</p>

 “At the place where we breakfasted to-day (Naval Carnero)
there is a really beautiful church of the Arabesque order. It has
two Moorish towers, with the sphere and globe: the interior is
most devotional. I thought the Moorish arches of the nave
quite equal for devotional effect to the Gothic, which it much
resembles. Nothing could be more chaste. The interior besides
was very neatly kept, which, in these days of revolution and robbery,
is no slight matter. If it had not been in Spain, I should
have thought that I was in a Gothic church.”—<cite>Extract from a

 “A large square plinth of marble extends from the top of
one column to the other, and above it there are constructed a
number of arches all round, which support the inner end of the
roof or ceiling, the outer end resting on the walls of the building.
This is composed of wood or plaster, highly ornamented with a
species of carving, and richly gilt.”—<span class="smcap">Russel’s</span> <cite>Palestine</cite>,
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 500.</p>

<p class="footnote">Dr. Richardson speaks of it as the most beautiful building he
had ever beheld; but gives no description.</p>

<p class="footnote">Ali Bey observes, that “the great centre nave of the mosque
Al Aksa is supported on each side by seven arches lightly pointed,
resting upon cylindrical pillars, in the form of columns, with
foliaged capitals, which do not belong to any order: the fourth
pillar to the right of the entrance is octangular and enormously
thick, called the Pillar of Sidi Omar.”—P. 501.</p>

<p class="footnote">On the conclusion of this work, there was a letter from the
architects to the calif, as given by Jellal Addin, which may be
read in our days with perhaps some profit, or at least surprise:—</p>

<p class="footnote">“<em>God hath brought to an end</em> that which the Commander of
believers hath commanded us respecting the erection of the chapel
of the sakhra, the sakhra of the Holy City, and the mosque Al
Aksa. <em>And there remains not a word to be spoken about it.</em>
Moreover there remains <em>some surplus above the money granted</em> us
by the Commander of believers to that end, after 100,000 dinars
have been expended thereon. Let the Commander of believers
convert it to the object he likes best.”—<cite>Temple of Jerusalem</cite>,

 “It is remarkable for an elegant doorway, with clustered
pillars in the European or Gothic style, such as might be found
in one of our churches, and therefore differing in character from
Saracenic architecture. Over this door is an inscription, purporting
that the building was erected by the Sultan Mohammed,
son of the Sultan El Melek El Munsoor E’deen Kalaoón E’Salehee.
The date on the lintel is 698 <span class="allsmcap">A.H.</span>
(or <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1299), and on the body
of the building, 695. The minaret which stands above this
Gothic entrance is remarkable for its lace-like fretwork, which
calls to mind the style of the Alhambra and of the Al Cazar at
Seville.”</p>

<p class="footnote">“The pointed arch was evidently employed in Egypt previous
to the accession of the Fatimite dynasty, and consequently long
before it was known in any part of Europe.”—<span class="smcap">Wilkinson’s</span>

 It is supposed to have been the capital of the Carthaginian
colonies. It is held a place of peculiar sanctity, and no Christian

twelfth century.</p>

<a href="#fnanchor_382"><span class="muchsmaller">[382]</span></a>
 The pointed arch is here merely in the substance of the wall,
placed to strengthen it above the windows, with a low or four-centred
arch. The same is to be found in the gates of Jerusalem.</p>

 “An entire side of a chapel of the cathedral of Toledo,
opening out of the southernmost nave, is ornamented in the Arab
style, having been executed by a Moorish artist at the same
period as the rest; and not (as might be conjectured) having
belonged to the mosque, which occupied the same site previously
to the erection of the present cathedral.”—<span class="smcap">Wells’s</span> <cite>Antiquities</cite>,

 The fine colour then given to stained glass in Europe was
derived from the old mosaics, which were pounded and laid upon
the glass, and thus passed into the furnace. See Theophilus
<cite>Divers, Artium Cedula</cite>. Immense must have been the destruction
of ancient relics through this practice, to which the Moorish
mosaics were subject, as well as those of Rome and the glass of
the Phœnicians.</p>

 “In Gothic works the arch is an indispensable and governing
feature; it has pillars to support its vertical, and buttresses
to resist its lateral pressure: its summit may be carried upwards

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this

Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

    </div>
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark. Contact the Foundation as set

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will

and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
